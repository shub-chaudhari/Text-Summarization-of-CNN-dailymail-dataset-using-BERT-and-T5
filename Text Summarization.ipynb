The bishop of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A virus in late September and early October. The state Health Department has issued an advisory of exposure for anyone who attended five churches and took communion. Bishop John Folda (pictured) of the Fargo Catholic Diocese in North Dakota has exposed potentially hundreds of church members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown to the hepatitis A . State Immunization Program Manager Molly Howell says the risk is low, but officials feel it's important to alert people to the possible exposure. The diocese announced on Monday that Bishop John Folda is taking time off after being diagnosed with hepatitis A. The diocese says he contracted the infection through contaminated food while attending a conference for newly ordained bishops in Italy last month. Symptoms of hepatitis A include fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, nausea and abdominal discomfort.

Outside the office, authorities allege that the 45-year-old longtime officer worked with a drug trafficking organization to help plan a murder plot and get guns. A criminal complaint unsealed in U.S. District Court in New Jersey Tuesday accuses Mata, also known as \"The Milk Man,\" of using his role as a police officer to help the drug trafficking organization in exchange for money and gifts, including a Rolex watch. In one instance, the complaint alleges, Mata arranged to pay two assassins to kill rival drug dealers. The killers would pose as cops, pulling over their targets before shooting them, according to the complaint. \"Ultimately, the (organization) decided not to move forward with the murder plot, but Mata still received a payment for setting up the meetings,\" federal prosecutors said in a statement. The complaint also alleges that Mata used his police badge to purchase weapons for drug traffickers. Mata, according to the complaint, then used contacts at the airport to transport the weapons in his carry-on luggage on trips from Miami to the Dominican Republic. Court documents released by investigators do not specify the name of the drug trafficking organization with which Mata allegedly conspired but says the organization has been importing narcotics from places such as Ecuador and the Dominican Republic by hiding them \"inside shipping containers containing pallets of produce, including bananas.\" The organization \"has been distributing narcotics in New Jersey and elsewhere,\" the complaint says. Authorities arrested Mata on Tuesday in Miami Gardens, Florida. It was not immediately clear whether Mata has an attorney, and police officials could not be immediately reached for comment. Mata has worked for the Miami-Dade Police Department since 1992, including directing investigations in Miami Gardens and working as a lieutenant in the K-9 unit at Miami International Airport, according to the complaint. Since March 2010, he had been working in the internal affairs division. Mata faces charges of aiding and abetting a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, conspiring to distribute cocaine and engaging in monetary transactions in property derived from specified unlawful activity. He is scheduled to appear in federal court in Florida on Wednesday. If convicted, Mata could face life in prison.

Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, was driving home from a night at a pub when he received a text message. As he was reading or replying to it, he veered across the road while driving round a bend and smashed into Rachel Titleyâ€™s car coming the other way. Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27 (left) was using his mobile phone when he crashed head-on into the car being driven by Rachel Titley, 28 (right). She died later from her injuries . The head-on crash took place in October 2013. Mr Eccleston-Todd's car was barely recognisable (pictured) Police said Eccleston-Todd had drunk at least three or four pints of beer before getting behind the wheel. He was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving at Portsmouth Crown Court yesterday. Miss Titley, a 28-year-old solicitorâ€™s clerk from Cowes, Isle of Wight, had also spent the evening with friends at a pub but had not drunk any alcohol, police said. She was driving responsibly and there was â€˜nothing she could have done to avoid the collisionâ€™, they added. Lindsay Pennell, prosecuting, said: â€˜Craig Eccleston-Toddâ€™s driving resulted in the tragic death of a young woman, Rachel Titley, a death that could have been avoided. â€˜Mr Eccleston-Todd took the decision to pick up his mobile phone whilst driving and, either reading or replying to this text message, was so distracted that he failed to negotiate a left-hand bend, crossing the central white line into the path of Miss Titleyâ€™s oncoming car. Miss Titley was pulled the wreckage of herÂ Daihatsu Cuore but died later from her injuries in hospital . â€˜Miss Titley [had] a bright future ahead of her. She was also returning home having spent an enjoyable evening with friends and was driving responsibly. â€˜She had arranged to contact her friends when she got home to confirm that she had arrived safely. Her friends sadly never heard from her after they parted company. â€˜Miss Titleyâ€™s death in these circumstances reiterates the danger of using a hand-held mobile phone whilst driving.â€™ Police were unable to take breath or blood tests from Eccleston-Todd immediately, but in tests several hours after the accident he was only marginally under the drink-drive limit. The judge agreed with police that he would have been over the limit at the time his red Citroen hit Miss Titleyâ€™s blue Daihatsu Cuore on a road near Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, on October 11, 2013. His phone records showed he was also texting around the time of the crash. PC Mark Furse, from Hampshire constabularyâ€™s serious collision investigation unit, said: 'Our thoughts are with Rachel's family at this time. She had been out with friends at a pub in Shalfleet that evening, but had not had any alcohol. 'Our investigation showed that there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision and sadly it cost her her life. 'Mr Eccleston-Todd had left work in Yarmouth and met with friends at a pub where he drank at least three to four pints of lager. He hadn't long left the pub to return home when the collision occurred at around 9.30pm. 'We weren't able to take breath or blood tests from him immediately and although blood taken several hours after the collision showed he was marginally under the limit, we maintain he would have been over the limit at the time of the collision and in summing up today, the judge agreed. 'The analysis of his phone records showed that he was texting on his phone around the time of the collision so it's highly likely this would also have contributed to his dangerous driving and loss of control.' Eccleston-Todd was found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving following a trial at Portsmouth Crown Court (pictured) He added: 'Mr Eccleston-Todd will now spend six years behind bars, but Rachel's family have lost her forever. 'I hope this will make people think twice before drinking any alcohol and getting behind the wheel, or using a phone once they're on the road. 'The dangers of drink driving and driving whilst using a mobile phone are obvious. Those who continue to do so risk spending a substantial time in prison.

Sixty years prior, Ukraine's breakaway peninsula was signed away just as swiftly by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. But dealing with such a blatant land grab on its eastern flank won't be anywhere near as quick and easy for Europe's 28-member union. Because, unlike Crimea's rushed referendum, everyone has a say. After initially slapping visa restrictions and asset freezes on a limited number of little known politicians and military men, Europe is facing urgent calls to widen the scope of its measures to target the Russian business community in particular. The logic of this is that those who run Russia and own it are essentially two sides of the coin. Alexei Navalny, one-time Moscow mayoral contender now under house arrest for opposing the current regime, called for Europe's leaders to ban everyone -- from Vladimir Putin's personal banker to Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich from keeping their money and loved ones abroad. Asset freezes and visa restrictions are especially palatable options for the EU because they can be rolled out on a discretionary basis, without requiring cumbersome legal procedures and recourse. In fact Russia cancels visas for people it doesn't like all the time. Just look at Hermitage Capital founder Bill Browder who lost both his right of entry and Moscow-based money in 2005 and dare not go back. Russia also banned the adoption of its orphans by Americans in retaliation for the US's implementation of an anti-corruption law named after Sergei Magnitsky, Browder's lawyer who died after a year in a Moscow detention center, apparently beaten to death. Yet in playing the 'money talks' card, Europe must be ready for the consequences of such action. Because money also walks. As such EU leaders must be ready to accept sanctions are a two-way street and will hurt both sides. Targeting Russia's peripatetic business community would be one way of sapping their tenuous support for President Putin. And such a strategy might also turn out to have a silver lining: awarding EU countries a chance to finally deal with some of the more unpleasant sides of their patronage, including money laundering and corruption, which have inflated prize assets like London property and Picasso paintings for years. Where Europe should hold fire though is trade. Two decades of post-Soviet rapprochement and almost $500 billion worth of commerce is a lot to put at stake. It's true that any trade war would hurt Russia far harder than it would the EU - not least because 15% of the former's GDP comes from exports to the bloc. But Europe - with its hefty reliance on Russian gas - would have a hard time keeping its factories going and citizens warm without power from the east. And while Putin flexes his political muscle, open trade channels keep the dialogue going giving all sides a chance to change the subject and talk less tensely. No one can afford to cut off that lifeline, especially now with Europe's economy on the rebound and Russia's one on the wane.   \n","4  0003ad6ef0c37534f80b55b4235108024b407f0b                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Fleetwood are the only team still to have a 100% record in Sky Bet League One as a 2-0 win over Scunthorpe sent Graham Alexanderâ€™s men top of the table. The Cod Army are playing in the third tier for the first time in their history after six promotions in nine years and their remarkable ascent shows no sign of slowing with Jamie Proctor and Gareth Evans scoring the goals at Glanford Park. Fleetwood were one of five teams to have won two out of two but the other four clubs - Peterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley - all hit their first stumbling blocks. Posh were defeated 2-1 by Sheffield United, who had lost both of their opening contests. Jose Baxterâ€™s opener gave the Blades a first-half lead, and although it was later cancelled out by Shaun Brisleyâ€™s goal, Ben Davies snatched a winner six minutes from time. In the lead: Jose Baxter (right) celebrates opening the scoring for Sheffield United . Up for the battle: Sheffield United's Michael Doyle (left) challenges Peterborough's Kyle Vassell in a keenly-contested clash . Bristol City, who beat Nigel Cloughâ€™s men on the opening day, were held to a goalless draw by last season's play-off finalists Leyton Orient while Chesterfield, the League Two champions, were beaten 1-0 by MK Dons, who play Manchester United in the Capital One Cup in seven daysâ€™ time. Arsenal loanee Benik Afobe scored the only goal of the game just after the break. Meanwhile, Crawley lost their unbeaten status, while Bradford maintained theirs, thanks to a 3-1 win for the Bantams. James Hanson became the first player to score against Crawley this season after 49 minutes before Joe Walsh equalised five minutes later. Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header . But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncasterâ€™s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the eveningâ€™s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2. Marcus Haber marked his full Railwaymen debut with a brace but Doneâ€™s treble and goals from Ian Henderson and Peter Vincenti helped Keith Hillâ€™s men to a big away victory. There were plenty of goals between Coventry and Barnsley too in a 2-2 draw with all four goals coming in the first half. Josh McQuoid and Jordan Clarke twice gave the Sky Blues the lead, but the Tykes earned a point thanks to strikes from Conor Hourihane and Leroy Lita. Notts County recorded a 2-1 home win over Colchester with Ronan Murray and Liam Noble on target. Freddie Sears replied for Colchester. James Wilson's second half equaliser earned Oldham a points against Port Vale after Tom Pope's opener and Yeovil claimed a 2-1 away victory at Walsall with Kevin Dawson striking a late winner. Tom Bradshaw had equalised after veteran James Hayter gave the Glovers the lead. Finally, Swindon held Gillingham to a 2-2 draw thanks to Stephen Bywaterâ€™s last-minute own goal. Danny Kedwell and Kortney Hause twice gave the Gills the lead but Andy Williams pulled Swindon level before Bywater dropped Raphael Branco's cross into his own net.   \n","\n","                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               highlights  \n","0                                                                                                                                                                                          Bishop John Folda, of North Dakota, is taking time off after being diagnosed .\\nHe contracted the infection through contaminated food in Italy .\\nChurch members in Fargo, Grand Forks and Jamestown could have been exposed .  \n","1                                                                                                                                                                                       Criminal complaint: Cop used his role to help cocaine traffickers .\\nRalph Mata, an internal affairs lieutenant, allegedly helped group get guns .\\nHe also arranged to pay two assassins in a murder plot, a complaint alleges .  \n","2              Craig Eccleston-Todd, 27, had drunk at least three pints before driving car .\\nWas using phone when he veered across road in Yarmouth, Isle of Wight .\\nCrashed head-on into 28-year-old Rachel Titley's car, who died in hospital .\\nPolice say he would have been over legal drink-drive limit at time of crash .\\nHe was found guilty at Portsmouth Crown Court of causing death by dangerous driving .  \n","3                                                                                                             Nina dos Santos says Europe must be ready to accept sanctions will hurt both sides .\\nTargeting Russia's business community would be one way of sapping their support for President Putin, she says .\\nBut she says Europe would have a hard time keeping its factories going without power from the east .  \n","4  Fleetwood top of League One after 2-0 win at Scunthorpe .\\nPeterborough, Bristol City, Chesterfield and Crawley all drop first points of the season .\\nStand-in striker Matt Done scores a hat-trick as Rochdale thrash Crewe 5-2 .\\nWins for Notts County and Yeovil .\\nCoventry/Bradford and Oldham/Port Vale both end in draws .\\nA late Stephen Bywater own goal denies Gillingham three points against Millwall .  \n","<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n","RangeIndex: 287113 entries, 0 to 287112\n","Data columns (total 3 columns):\n"," #   Column      Non-Null Count   Dtype \n","---  ------      --------------   ----- \n"," 0   id          287113 non-null  object\n"," 1   article     287113 non-null  object\n"," 2   highlights  287113 non-null  object\n","dtypes: object(3)\n","memory usage: 6.6+ MB\n","None\n","(287113, 3)\n","(287113, 2)\n","Index(['article', 'summary'], dtype='object')\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# To get all the special characters\n","\n","# Dictionary to store consecutive special character frequency\n","consecutive_char_freq = {}\n","\n","# Loop through all columns and rows\n","for col in df.columns:\n","    for value in df[col]:\n","        # Find all sequences of consecutive special characters using regular expression\n","        consecutive_special_chars = re.findall(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9]+', str(value))  # Matches consecutive non-alphanumeric characters\n","\n","        # Count the occurrences of each consecutive sequence\n","        for sequence in consecutive_special_chars:\n","            if sequence in consecutive_char_freq:\n","                consecutive_char_freq[sequence] += 1\n","            else:\n","                consecutive_char_freq[sequence] = 1\n","\n","# Display the dictionary of consecutive special characters and their frequencies\n","sorted_dict = dict(sorted(consecutive_char_freq.items(), key=lambda item: item[1]))\n","print(sorted_dict)"],"metadata":{"id":"55WYzpjdxx9f","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1739216945627,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":143240,"user":{"displayName":"Pratik Hingnekar","userId":"12538235837245064799"}},"outputId":"c9539e12-e229-4b79-8bed-0bb8281bc449"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["{\"!').

Attorney General Scott Pruitt's office said it wouldn't object to.180-day stay of execution being sought by attorneys for inmate Charles Warner while the investigation is underway. Warner was scheduled for execution on the same night last week as Clayton Lockett in what would have been the state's first double execution since 1937. Murderer and rapist Clayton Lockett (left) and convicted murderer and rapist Charles Warner (right).  Lockett died of.heart attack on April 29 more than 40 minutes after his execution was halted due to.botched lethal injection, leading Oklahoma to postpone the execution of Warner.But Lockett's vein collapsed during his lethal injection, prompting prison officials to halt the execution. He later died of.heart attack. Gov. Mary Fallin then issued.two-week stay of execution for Warner, but his attorneys asked for.six month delay. Pruitt's office agreed in.motion filed with the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals, and if the court agrees, Warner's execution would be postponed until November 13. 'Should additional time be needed for the implementation of any changes or adjustments, the state will request it,' Assistant Attorney General Seth Branham wrote. Lockett writhed on the gurney, gritted his teeth, lifted his head several times and moaned before dying of an apparent heart attack 43 minutes after the start of his execution..doctor inside the death chamber during the execution reported that Lockett's vein collapsed and some of the lethal drugs were absorbed into his tissue or leaked out. The curtains that allow witnesses to view the execution were closed about 16 minutes into the lethal injection, after Lockett had been showing signs of distress for several minutes. The director of the state's prison system, Robert Patton, then called off the execution, but Lockett died about 10 minutes later. Patton released.report saying Lockett had an intravenous tap placed at his groin because suitable veins couldn't be found elsewhere in his body. That vein collapsed, and Patton said Lockett didn't have another viable one.and that the state didn't have another dose of the drugs available. The former warden of Oklahoma State Penitentiary said on Wednesday that Lockett's painful death was not 'botched' but probably due to his on actions of cutting his arms, refusing food and not drinking water so that he was too dehydrated for officials to find.viable vein. Randall Workman, who retired in 2012, told The Edmond Sun: 'It was an untimely execution. It worked. He died. The bottom line is the drugs did what they were supposed to do. They killed him.'   \n","123935                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          (CNN) -- At least seven people died and dozens were injured as Syrian troops assaulted demonstrators who took to the streets after Friday prayers, witnesses and activists said. Troops used gunfire amid protests in the Damascus suburb of Douma, according to witnesses and opposition sources, and one witness saw at least six dead demonstrators taken into.hospital morgue. Witnesses also said.man was shot in the head with.rubber bullet and dozens were injured. Another death and 10 injuries occurred when troops shot at protesters marching toward the southern town of Al Sanameen, witnesses said. Protests also were reported by witnesses in the cities of Daraa, Latakia, Homs, Baniyas and Kamishli, sources said. Opposition sources cited witnesses in Homs as saying thousands of people had gathered around.mosque. Security forces used tear gas in several locations to try to disperse demonstrators, witnesses said. Anti-government activists had promised demonstrations in Syria on Friday to air their grievances against the Bashar al-Assad government. Tensions have been high as dozens of people have been killed recently in Daraa in the south and Latakia in the west -- both centers of ferment. Thousands of demonstrators from different villages and towns gathered near Daraa and marched toward Al Sanameen. They were 25,000 strong by the time they reached.military checkpoint just outside the city, witnesses said. About 1,000 heavily armed troops at the checkpoint fired on demonstrators forcibly trying to cross the spot and enter Al Sanameen, witnesses said. \"Their blood is on my shirt and we are tending to the wounded as we speak,\".witness said. Ambulance sirens could be heard in the background during the witness's phone call to CNN. Demonstrators are staying at the checkpoint and demanding they be allowed into the city. According to an eyewitness, the gunfire had stopped and protesters were trying to appeal to soldiers, chanting, \"The people and the army are one hand.\" They also chanted, \"With our bloods, our souls we will sacrifice for you, Daraa.\" One witness said security forces attacked thousands of protesters at the \"big mosque\" in the center of Douma with electric batons, tear gas and live ammunition. \"I have never in my life seen such violence: men shooting guns into an unarmed crowd without.thought,\" said the eyewitness, who had been hurt in an electric-baton beating and taken to the hospital for.head injury. Along with the six dead, he said, he saw dozens of wounded, many of whom were seriously injured. Another Douma demonstrator claimed his son had been injured in the gunfire. Haitham Maleh,.Syrian human rights lawyer recently freed from prison, said he spoke to rights activists who reported two deaths in Douma. Witnesses said.mosque in Kafr Sousa, another Damascus suburb, had been surrounded by security forces who had fired rubber bullets, and Maleh said he was told about the unrest there. \"Hundreds are now trapped in Abdul Karim Rifai mosque in Kafr Sousa near Damascus,\" he said. \"They called me to say that more than 50 people were injured and taken away from the mosque to security headquarters after being brutally beaten in the street.\" CNN could not independently confirm the witness accounts, and it is not known whether the two people Maleh reported dead are among or in addition to the six the eyewitness reported. The Syrian government has made no public comment about Friday's events, though the Syrian Arab News Agency (SANA), citing an official source, said armed groups in Douma fired on security forces and civilians, killing \"several\" people and injuring \"dozens\" of others. In Homs,.group shot into.crowd, killing.girl, SANA said. The agency reported protesters and security forces did not clash in Daraa and Latakia. In some Syrian provinces, people took to the streets to call for national unity, SANA said. Activists, who have many political and economic grievances, have been riled in recent days by President al-Assad. They are upset that he failed to announce the lifting of the country's state of emergency during.national TV address on Wednesday and didn't properly address, in their view, complaints and concerns of people in the streets. On Thursday, however, Syria said it will study the idea of lifting the country's state of emergency and promptly investigate the deaths of civilians and troops in two flashpoint regions. Al-Assad ordered the Supreme Judicial Council to form.committee that would conduct \"an immediate investigation in all cases that killed.number of civilians and military personnel.\" The committee exploring the lifting of the emergency law is expected to complete the study before April 25. It will be made up of senior lawyers, SANA reported. One of the key demands of the demonstrators who have taken to the streets in the country's major cities is the scrapping of the law, which has been in place since 1963. The emergency law allows the government to make preventive arrests and override constitutional and penal code statutes. It also bars detainees who haven't been charged from filing court complaints or from having.lawyer present during interrogations. \"It's extremely disappointing that President al-Assad has done nothing more than repeat the same vague promises of reform that he's been uttering for over.decade,\" said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director at Human Rights Watch. \"What's needed immediately if the authorities are to restore any shred of credibility are concrete actions to dismantle Syria's special courts and abolish provisions that criminalize free speech, assembly and association.\" CNN's Mustafa al-Arab contributed to this report.   \n","51062   By.Rebecca Camber.UPDATED:.11:41 EST, 24 January 2012.On trial: Asil Nadir arrives at the Old Bailey, London, with his wife, Nur.It has been nearly 19 years since he famously fled British justice. But yesterday Asil Nadir finally went on trial for allegedly stealing £150million to fund his luxury lifestyle. The 70-year-old is accused of plundering his Polly Peck business empire to pay for lavish properties, cars and gifts for himself and his family, causing the firm to collapse nearly 22 years ago. The tycoon, who had at his disposal.five company cars including Bentleys and.Ferrari Testarossa, as well.as.company aeroplane, then fled as fraud investigators closed in. On.the eve of his trial in May 1993 he jetted off to his native Northern.Cyprus where he set up home. It.was not until August 2010 that Nadir flew back to London and was.re-arrested. Yesterday the former fugitive entered the Old Bailey.grinning as he prepared to go into the dock for the first time to face.13 charges of theft. Nadir.stopped to shake hands and wave at supporters after arriving in.. presidential-style cavalcade. He was flanked by minders and accompanied.by his glamorous second wife Nur, 27. The.defendant sat calmly as the court heard how he raided the firm's.accounts to splash out on.string of million pound properties and.luxuries such as.new Mercedes for his first wife Ayshegul, cash for.his son Birol and livestock for.'model farm' on.country estate in.Leicestershire. He even used the stolen cash to pay off his tax bill and debts, it was alleged. Nadir.is facing trial over 13 specimen counts of theft amounting to.£33million and $2.5million. But prosecutor Philip Shears, QC, said the.'much bigger picture' was that he stole £146million and $6.4million in.. total of 64 transfers. The cash was allegedly taken between August 1987 and August 1990 from three accounts held by Polly Peck International (PPI),.major international conglomerate which had more than 200 subsidiaries trading in food, electronics, textiles and leisure and housed the Del Monte fruit business. Nadir is said to have ordered his henchmen to take out bags of bank notes, often totalling £100,000, from banks which he 'dishonestly routed away to benefit himself, his family or associates'. Mr Shears told jurors: 'Mr Nadir was chairman and chief executive of PPI. He was.man who wielded very considerable power over its operations and management and that of its subsidiaries, particularly in Northern Cyprus. In the dock:.court drawing shows Nadir on the opening day of his trial, where the Old Bailey heard he stole £150m from his business empire.'Dishonest': Nadir and his wife Nur at court, where Nadir is on trial over allegations he stole £34million.'We say he abused that power and helped himself to tens of millions of pounds of PPI's money. 'The time span of the counts is.between 1987 and 1990. That is.long time ago. Why are we trying.matters so long ago? The answer is simple. He was due to stand his trial.in late 1993 but in May of 1993 he fled the country to Northern Cyprus,.thus leaving the jurisdiction, only to return in August 2010. 'The funds were used in.variety of ways for the benefit of Nadir himself, his family and his associates.' Exit: Nadir leaves court this evening following the conclusion of the day's proceedings at the Old Bailey.The jury heard that Nadir hid.£7.5million he siphoned off from his firm in his mother, Safiye's, bank.accounts. The rest of the stolen cash went through.complex series of.transactions through companies in Switzerland and the Bahamas and.bank.he owned in Northern Cyprus, it was said. When the company folded owing more.than £550million, administrators found that the vast majority of cash.was held in Northern Cyprus. By December 1989, £202.6million.81.per cent of all Polly Peck's cash balances.was held by its Turkish and.Northern Cyprus companies. By the end of June 1990 this had risen to.£305.8million. When questioned about the cash.transfers, Nadir allegedly told his board it made good business sense.and that he needed to pay citrus growers for produce. Shortly before the firm collapsed in.October 1990, Nadir increased his salary from £200,000 to £350,000, the.court heard. Mr Shears said: 'When the administrators went to Northern.Cyprus they effectively found no cash at all, just.black hole. We say.there is.perfectly good explanation for that.it had gone. Mr Nadir.had stolen it.' The jury heard that Nadir was the.dominant force in the company which he built up from an ailing textiles.firm in the early 1980s. Mr Shears said: 'He directed its.affairs in an autocratic manner and refused to tolerate rival sources of.power in the management or to accept constraints upon his freedom of.action.' Unlike other businesses, PPI operated.with.single signatory system where only one member of the board could.authorise the transfer of funds as Nadir refused to 'surrender the power.to transfer funds'. But he relied on help from his alleged.accomplice, Elizabeth Forsyth, his 'personal financial officer' who was.managing director of South Audley Management (SAM) which ran most of.the money transactions. Jason Davies, another director of SAM, also.'provided assistance to Nadir in his dishonest enterprise', the court.heard. They allegedly worked together to help.Nadir use PPI money to secretly buy £26.2million in PPI shares to prop.up its share price, which allowed the company to borrow more from banks,.helped maintain the value of Nadir's own shareholding and prevented.lenders forcing the sale of his personal stock. The court heard that Nadir also used the cash to invest in businesses he owned or controlled.

The \"12 Years.Slave\" actor said he was an \"idiot\" and \"devastated\" at his choice of words during an interview with PBS' Tavis Smiley about the lack of diversity in the British film industry. Cumberbatch, 38, told Smiley: \"I think as far as colored actors go, it gets really difficult in the UK, and.think.lot of my friends have had more opportunities here [in the U.S.] than in the UK, and that's something that needs to change.\" His comments were criticized by some observers on Twitter as being insensitive and out of touch. One user called Sonya Thomas asked: \"Benedict Cumberbatch used the term 'coloured' to describe black actors.

North Korea denies it sunk the ship and has sharply criticized the military exercises, describing them as war games conducted under.false pretext. \"The U.S. forces side would be seriously mistaken if it calculates it can browbeat [North Korea] through large-scale war exercises,\" the state-run KCNA news agency said in July. \"It should immediately stop the [anti-North Korean] nuclear war racket.\" \"[This] double-dealing attitude is.dangerous one of driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to.war phase,\" KCNA said.   \n","15733                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   By.Daily Mail Reporter.Last updated at 6:36 PM on 20th September 2011.A babysitter facing charges of sexual assault on.child is now accused of having sex with.second 14-year-old boy.

They say primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops. The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council which represents medical schools all over the country, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study the subject. Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while.third were privately educated. Medicine is.very popular career choice, the guidance says, with fierce competition. 'Medical schools have worked hard so that they can attract the right candidates and to establish admissions processes which are fair to all,' it says. 'Yet it remains that more needs to be done to ensure that the medical profession is representative of the society it serves, and that medical students are able to learn in.diverse environment.' This is the first time that the council has published advice on how to widen access to medical courses. It suggests that the 'journey to medicine' should start in primary schools, an area which is sometimes overlooked by medical schools. Pupils should be told about the qualifications and routes to becoming.doctor, the guidance says, and take part in 'lively and fun' activities linked to the profession. This could include roadshows, campus visits, demonstrations and workshops. 'Medical students acting as ambassadors are often the best people to lead activity, which can include demonstrations, campus tours and mentoring,' it says. 'Some medical schools formally recognise this work by medical students as part of their educational development.' In secondary schools, students should be taught about studying medicine at university and what.career in the profession involves. This includes helping pupils make the right subject choices for their GCSEs, Scottish Nationals, A-levels and other qualifications. The guidance goes on to suggest that when pupils are in the sixth-form, medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications, including support in writing personal statements and preparing for interviews and admissions tests. Experts said primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops to help encourage them to train up.They could also run master classes and summer schools for secondary school pupils of all ages. Professor Tony Weetman, chair of the Selecting for Excellence Executive Group, said: 'A candidate's journey to.medical degree starts long before the Ucas application is made. 'The commitment in terms of hard work and academic achievement is of course essential, but before that must come the awareness that studying medicine is an option. 'That realisation does not come readily to all potential candidates, be they school students or mature learners, and we know that one's background will play.central part here. 'Medical schools cannot leave potentially excellent candidates to learn this message on their own; they have.responsibility, where possible, to reach out to these people and show them first-hand that.career in medicine is for anyone with the ability and commitment.' Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: 'This guidance represents.major development in helping to improve access to the elite medical profession. 'Going to medical school opens the door to.career in.rewarding, high-status profession and that door should be open to everyone who has what it takes to be an excellent doctor, regardless of their background.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Medical Schools Council publishes advice on how to widen access to medical courses.Pupils should be told about qualifications and routes to becoming.doctor.Medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications.\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," There are more than 7,000 islands and reefs sprinkled throughout the Caribbean Sea. Isn't it time you explored some place new? We've unearthed six singular destinations where you can stake out your own quiet stretch of sand. Isla de Providencia, Colombia The residents of Providencia,.25-minute flight from neighboring San AndrÃ©s Island, make much of their association with Sir Henry Morgan, the 17th-century swashbuckler de picted on rum bottles worldwide. As well they should: Only.492-foot-long floating bridge separates Providencia from Santa Catalina, one of Morgan's favorite bases..quarter-mile hike to the top of Providencia's El Pico yields 360-degree views of pristine rain forests and of the area where Morgan hid his loot. Near Aguadulce Bay, Hotel El Pirata Morgan's 27 rooms have private balconies, many overlooking the pool (011-57/8-514-8232, from $62). About four miles away at Playa Manzanillo, Roland Roots Bar hosts beach parties with reggae music and drinks served in coconut shells (no phone, from $7.75). Comarca Kuna Yala, Panama One of Panama's largest indigenous groups, the Kuna people have lived on the Comarca Kuna Yala chain of more than 350 islands and coral cays since the 1600s. Kuna women make and sell molas, swatches of hand-embroidered cloth in vivid purples, reds, and blues that are typically made into garments. The men spend their days fishing for grouper and mackerel and leading visitors on boat trips to the archipelago's dozens of uninhabited islands, some barely 100 yards wide. Many hotels here offer immersive, all-inclusive experiences. At CabaÃ±as Uaguinega on Achutupu Island, 45 minutes from Panama City by air, the rate for.bamboo-walled, solar-powered cabin covers two tours or cultural outings daily and all meals (uaguinega.com, from $140 per person). Water Island, U.S. Virgin Islands To call Heidi's Honeymoon Grill.restaurant would be an overstatement it's.food truck that parks on the beach and serves patrons seated at picnic tables but it's about as close to an actual restaurant as you'll get on this 490-acre speck of land.10-minute ferry ride from St. Thomas. Honeymoon Beach serves as the unofficial community center for Water Island's 161 residents, hosting Monday night golf-cart drive-in movies, Wednesday night bingo, and candlelit gourmet dinners catered by Heidi's on Saturday evenings (340/777-5288, $25). Most people stay in one of the more than.dozen vacation homes (vrbo.com, from $1,200 for.week). Budget Travel: The Dominican Republic's last frontier  Anegada, British Virgin Islands The 32-mile Horseshoe Reef surrounds tiny Anegada,.low-slung coral atoll that's.12-minute flight from Beef Island. What the reef means for travelers is.lot more than great snorkeling; it protects some of the longest beaches in the British Virgin Islands and has also netted 200-plus shipwrecks, ripe for divers' explorations. Pomato Point Restaurant, on the southwest shore, is known as much for its museum of shipwreck artifacts as it is for its swordfish and conch dishes (284/495-9466, entrÃ©es from $20). At the nearby Neptune's Treasure hotel, paintings of boats on stormy seas hang in the nine rooms, set about 150 feet from the water (neptunestreasure.com, from $95). Terre-de-Haut, Guadeloupe You could be forgiven.double take upon arriving at Terre-de-Haut,.45-minute ferry ride from Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe: It's like.slice of northwestern France, with goats nibbling scrubby plants on the hillsides and.culture steeped in the ways of early settlers from Brittany. In the villages, fishermen still mend nets on their front porches, while women sell tropical fruit tarts (called tourment d'amour) from wicker baskets. Even the 12 guest rooms at Auberge Les Petits Saints are decorated with French antiques (petitssaints.com, from $131). But it's not all about old times.cosmopolitan yachting crowd regularly drops anchor (and their swimsuits) at the west coast's Anse Crawen beach. Budget Travel: Nonstop Caribbean: Fly right to the beach.Carriacou, Grenada There's no need to worry about high-rise resorts blocking your view on this 13-square-mile island.22-minute flight from Grenada; unwritten law forbids building.hotel taller than the average palm tree. Near Hillsborough, on the island's west coast, the appropriately sized Green Roof Inn rents six rooms and two cottages with Wi-Fi and sea-view verandas (greenroofinn.com, from $70). Carriacou is also known for the easy coexistence of cultural traditions passed down by both West African slaves and early 19th-century Scottish settlers. Ritual \"big drum\" dances remain.vital part of life here; they're performed for funerals and festivals, including the Carriacou Regatta, in which sailors race boats built according to old Irish and Scottish shipwrights' plans. Flight and ferry news.In October, US Airways increased nonstop service from Philadelphia to Barbados, and JetBlue added flights from New York City to St. Lucia and Barbados.

The BBC versions of Great Expectations and the Mystery of Edwin Drood have created.resurgence of interest in the Victorian writer. It means Dickens could find himself back among the bestsellers' list alongside modern authors JK Rowling, Stig Larsson and Stephen King. Great Expectations: Popularity of the BBC version, which starred Douglas Booth as Pip, right, and Estella, Vanessa Kirby, has led to increased interest in the books.BBC hit: Great Expectations attracted.quarter of the audience share when it screened on December 27. Here Douglas Booth plays Pip and Gillian Anderson is Miss Havisham.An audience of more than six million watched Great Expectations on the BBC over Christmas. In the TV adaptation Douglas Booth, 19, starred as teenage Pip, alongside actors Ray Winstone and Gillian Anderson.

Nearly 360,000 women in their 30s gave birth last year.49 per cent of the total.and just under seven in ten were married, the Office for National Statistics said.

The.Office for National Statistics said: The overall rise since 1975.reflects the increasing numbers of women who have been delaying.childbearing to later ages. Possible.influences include increased participation in higher education,.increased female participation in the labour force, the increasing.importance of.career, the rising costs of childbearing, labour market.uncertainty, housing factors and instability of partnerships.'

This dropped to one in five among those aged.between 20 and 25. The ONS report suggests young mothers are.increasingly likely to be less well-off and in relationships that are.more likely to break down, while older mothers tend to be in stable.relationships and have reliable incomes. Previous.studies have found cohabiting relationships typically break up within.three years, often creating single-parent families. By contrast,.families of married couples are more likely to stay together, and are on.average wealthier, healthier, and the children benefit from.better.education.

The drone was used for covert.surveillance such as the operation to spy on the Pakistan compound of.Osama Bin Laden before he was killed in.U.S. raid in May. The TV also showed images purported to be the Sentinel landing at.base in eastern Iran. Narrating the video, the.Revolutionary Guard's air space chief, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, says.in one part that only after Iran captured the drone did it realise it 'belongs to the CIA.' Iranian officials have said the drone.came down over eastern Iran in December 2011, hundreds of miles from the cluster of.nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country.

'This aircraft has carried out many operations in the countries around Iran,' the narrator says. 'In the operations taken place in Pakistan, this aircraft guided many of the clashes ... Iran believes it can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft. When the drone went missing President Obama made it clear the U.S. wanted the top-secret aircraft back. 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,' Obama said during.White House news conference. But in.later interview Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made it clear his country would not grant the U.S. request. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him.'The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane,' Ahmadinejad said. 'We now have control of this plane.' Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyze this plane's system also. â€¦ In any case, now we have this spy plane.' At the time Obama wouldn't comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft.

'I don't expect that that will happen,' he said. 'But.think it's important to make that request.' Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney blasted Mr Obama for his soft approach in trying to get the surveillance plane back, insisting he should have ordered an airstrike over Iran instead. He told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. 'You can do that from the air and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone, but [Obama] asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The black and white video shows an aerial view of an airport and.city, said to be Kandahar in Afghanistan.The release comes at.sensitive time as.the U.S. increased sanctions on Iran on yesterday.\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," By.Chris Wheeler.Follow @ChrisWheelerDM.Liverpool's penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers's side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made.number of changes throughout Wednesday's match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium â€¦.Scroll down for videos.First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly.Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side.much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn't the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City's opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be.key player in that deep-lying role again this season. We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got.toe on it,' said the Liverpool boss. But he's been playing that role for the last 12 months and I'm sure he'll play it this season as well. He's got.wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he's very committed.' Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield.Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time.It's early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure's effort as the Ivorian made.subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: We played two different formations -.4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of.4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations.Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties.We had.connection through Coutinho who played.lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.' City lined up in more of.conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium.In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time.The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko,.think that they will be ready for the Premier League,' said Pellegrini. We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.' Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool's substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied.sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening's exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from.goal down. Even though it was.pre-season game it was highly competitive,' he said. The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was.really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are.top side, one of the best teams in Europe.' Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased.Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. It was.very useful game for both teams,' said the City boss. We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We've had.very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.' Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted.gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence.City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero,.new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out.work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Brendan Rodgers' side are set to be contenders again on August 17.Jordan Henderson, Philippe Coutinho and Raheem Sterling impressed.Making up for lost time after an injury-hit first season.\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Incredible images showing the cratered surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with.3D printed telescope.

Both Turner and White were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008, but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them.

There is renewed talk of creating safe havens and humanitarian corridors inside the country. And those demanding tougher measures are again asking why events in Syria should not prompt Libyan-style intervention by NATO and its Arab allies. In Washington Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the United States \"should consider all options, including arming the opposition. The blood-letting has got to stop.\" So far, the international community's response to the violence in Syria has been limited. There has been diplomatic censure, with envoys withdrawn or \"recalled for consultations,\" and Syrian ambassadors expelled from several Arab states..growing raft of sanctions is draining the Syrian regime's coffers but only gradually sapping its strength. This is not.country that has relied on international trade for its survival. An Arab League monitoring mission is in abeyance, after.much criticized few weeks on the ground that drew ridicule even from within its own ranks and fury (for its perceived complacency) from protesters. And back in November, France floated the idea of humanitarian corridors that would be protected by armed observers -- while ruling out military intervention. So far the idea has not gained traction. None of this amounts to the sort of pressure that will make the al-Assad regime buckle, especially when it perceives as divided both internal opposition and the international community. Compare the situation to that in Libya -- almost.year ago. As then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was about to unleash his forces on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, the world came together in the shape of the U.N. Security Council to authorize international intervention and prevent.bloodbath. The French and British were prime movers behind U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973; the United States an enthusiastic supporter. Russia abstained, but at the time its ambassador noted that many questions remained \"unanswered, including how it would be enforced and by whom, and what the limits of engagement would be.\" Russian later complained that.humanitarian mandate had become.blank check in support of the rebels. Perhaps in part because of the bad blood over Libya, the world body has reached no similar consensus over Syria. Rather, the opposite, with some of the harshest diplomatic language traded for years. To the United States, the vetoes were.\"travesty.\" German ambassador Peter Wittig essentially said that Moscow and Beijing had Syrian blood on their hands. \"China and Russia will now have to assume that responsibility in the face of the international public opinion and especially in the Arab world, the Arab citizens and, of course, in face of the Syrian people,\" Wittig said. Beyond the rhetoric, the vetoes had.more practical consequence. NATO officials have made it clear that the alliance cannot act, by enforcing.no-fly zone for example, without U.N. support. Writer Derek Flood, recently in Syria with elements of the Free Syrian Army, says NATO officials envision no role for the alliance in Syria this year. But they have not ruled out.\"coalition of the willing\" outside the NATO orbit. Both Russia and China are wary of any international action supporting protest against authoritarian rule. And Syria has been first the Soviet Union's -- and now Russia's -- key ally in the region after Egypt 'defected' in the 1970s. As it has for decades, Russia still supplies the Syrian government with weapons. One Russian analyst, Ruslan Pukhov, told CNN: \"Once the Assad regime vanishes, we have zero influence in the region.\" According to Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, al-Assad has ably judged the \"diplomatic red lines\" to keep Moscow onside. There have been no massacres on the scale of what happened in Hama 30 years ago (when thousands were killed after.brief uprising against his father's rule) that might have forced Russia into.corner. The persistent drip of civilian casualties over almost.year has not unleashed.tide of irresistible outrage. Last weekend's casualties in Homs, which opposition activists said numbered in the hundreds, may have changed that. But what can be done? In Bosnia, the international community declared \"safe havens\" for Muslims but failed to protect them. The result in July 1995 was Srebrenica, the worst massacre in Europe since 1945, when some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians were killed by Serb forces. Havens are only safe when protected against superior forces. Others support Sen. John McCain in arguing for arming the fledgling Free Syrian Army. Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, told CNN that is \"the most likely [option], that the Arab League countries, Turkey and probably NATO as well arms the Free Syrian Army, gives them the means to fight back. \"But then you've got.long and bloody civil war,\" Slaughter says -- reminiscent of Bosnia. Analysts say that even setting aside the lack of international will, successful intervention in Syria would pose problems not present in Libya:.Geography: Most regime targets in Libya were close to the Mediterranean coast and within easy reach of NATO air bases in Italy. Even so, NATO warplanes flew some 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce the no-fly zone, suppress air defenses and destroy command centers and armor. Military analysts say that, while no match for the best NATO members could summon, Syrian armed forces are better equipped and coordinated than anything Gadhafi could muster. Neighboring states: Few of Syria's neighbors would likely allow their territory to be used to pre-position supplies or military units. Certainly neither Iraq nor Lebanon, both countries with their own volatile sectarian mixes. The Hezbollah militia, strongly allied with Syria, remains powerful within Lebanon. The presence of foreign troops on Jordanian soil might have repercussions for.monarchy that already has plenty of problems domestically. Using Israeli territory would send the wrong message altogether. That leaves Turkey,.NATO member that has run out of patience with al-Assad. Last month, the Turkish foreign minister compared the Syrian president with former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, and on Tuesday Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned al-Assad -- pointedly in Arabic -- \"What goes around, comes around.\" Turkey has military bases (Incirlik, Diyarbakir) close to the border that -- theoretically -- could serve as staging posts for intervention. But even for the Turks, there would be risks -- including.flood of refugees and possible retaliation by Damascus supporting the Kurdish terrorist group active in Turkey, the PKK. Topography: Libya was flat desert; there was little cover for regime forces and most of the fighting was along.narrow coastal strip. \"Target acquisition\" was relatively simple. Syria's physical geography is more challenging; and much of its northern border with Turkey and Lebanon is mountainous, with few major roads. Getting aid into any safe havens within Syria would be.logistical nightmare. The opposition: The Libyan rebels, for all their military shortcomings, quickly grabbed.swathe of eastern Libya and major air and seaports in Benghazi and Tobruk that became their resupply hubs. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), at best, controls.few neighborhoods in Homs and elsewhere. 'The FSA has established very small slices of liberated territory,\" says Derek Flood, who has just left Idlib province close to the Turkish border. He says the FSA is poorly armed; he was told the price of weapons on the black market has soared, \"with.used AK-47 fetching as much as $2,000.$3,000.\" Flood says the FSA in that area wants.5 kilometer buffer zone inside Syria to provide protection from regime forces. Crucially, the regime retains control of Syria's frontiers, and its armed forces appear cohesive, according to analysts in the region. There have been military defections, mainly of low-rank conscripts, but not of entire units with their armor. Against all this and the political risks of western military action in yet another Muslim country, some argue there is.moral imperative -- as there was in Libya and Kosovo (done), Rwanda (ignored) and Bosnia (eventually.) Writing last month in The Atlantic, Steven Cook argued: \"If there is no intervention and political will to stop Assad's crimes remains absent, the world will once again have to answer for standing on the sidelines of.mass murder.\" Cook --.senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -- asked: \"At what point in the body count is international intervention deemed to be an acceptably worthwhile option that can have.positive effect on the situation? After Assad has killed 6,000 people? 7,000? 10,000? 20,000?\" Scholar Fouad Ajami agrees, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper: \"Not just the Russians and Chinese, shame to the rest of us. There's abdication elsewhere, by the Turks nearby, abdication by the Arab League and Washington. Washington spent an enormous amount of time chasing after the false mirage [that] maybe we can get the Russians and Chinese on board.\" Some also argue that, despite the price, there would also eventually be.strategic gain:.post-al-Assad Syria would unlikely be as close to Iran as is the current regime and might also deprive Hezbollah of critical regional support. Others see the risks of international intervention as outweighing any benefits, with the danger that civil war would inevitably spill into Lebanon. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice preferred tighter and more coordinated sanctions, saying that \"our strong preference is not to fuel what has the potential to become.full-blown civil war\" by arming the opposition. Diplomats expect.new \"contact group\" on Syria to involve at least the United States, France, the Arab League and Turkey. \"We think that the Assad regime is on its last legs, that the pressure is increasing, the economy is crumbling,\" Rice said. Syrians may already be discounting direct intervention by the West. In one YouTube video uploaded Tuesday from Homs,.doctor pleads for help from abroad. But he directs his message to the leaders of Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Sen.

Astrobotic's first mission will land near.pit in the Moon's Lacus Mortis region and demonstrate unprecedented landing precision.if it goes according to plan. Astrobotic's landing technology registers high-quality, real-time camera images taken during the lander's descent with terrain maps derived from orbital imagery to achieve safe landing at.precise destination. This capability enables Astrobotic's Griffin lander to fly directly over the pit, capturing close-up views of the floor and walls that cannot be seen from orbit or the ground, and then to land within 100m of the pit. It will search for ice that could help future explorers set up.moon base.and is powered by solat panels that give it the appearance of having.mohawk. The firm says everything from photos to rings can be placed in the capsules. Launch is by SpaceX Falcon 9.

Polaris is.robotic rover with.lunar drill, oven, and instruments for analyzing volatiles that will be delivered to the Moon's surface on Astrobotic's lunar lander. The lander guides the spacecraft into lunar orbit and controls descent to the surface. The lander delivers 262 kg of payload to any destination on the Moon to support robotic lunar missions like skylight exploration, sample return, regional prospecting, and polar volatile characterization. Polaris will have.drill capable of getting.metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice.Polaris prospects for water at the lunar poles. Polaris has vertical solar panels to generate 250W of power and two radiator panels to reject excess heat. Stereo cameras and laser are used to guide Polaris and generate 3-D video and models of the lunar surface. The robot communicates directly with Earth using.pointed S-band antenna to receive commands and send video and data. Polaris carries up to 80kg of payload, such as.drill to take core samples and science instruments to identify water content. Polaris is capable of driving and avoiding obstacles autonomously, including traverses into dark regions in the lunar pole's long shadows. Polaris' suspension maintains four-wheel ground contact over sloped and rocky lunar terrain without the use of springs. The robot will explore for ten days until the 14-day cryogenic lunar night begins, then hibernate, recover at sunrise, and continue to explore. The lander and rover are both built to tolerate this cryogenic cold. The life sized working prototype of the Polaris rover that could mine the moon in 2015.The Polaris rover is.½ feet tall,.feet wide and.almost.feet long. It can move at about.foot.second on.2-foot-diameter composite wheels. Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough.terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling. The.rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate.a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms. Polaris is.first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon. Observations.by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that.substantial amount of.water ice could exist at the lunar poles. That ice could be.source of.water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say. Polaris.can bore one meter into the lunar surface and.can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and.. sun that hugs the horizon. It has been developed for an expedition to.the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of.. SpaceX Falcon.launch vehicle. Polaris.is.flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that.will eventually land on the moon. It includes.number of flight-worthy.components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but.tough composite materials. This.will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing.and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning.software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon.within 10 feet. The Polaris rover will hunt for ice on the moon that can be mined to help set up moon bases for future explorers.Astrobotic.—led by CMU's William 'Red' Whittaker.—develops robotics technology for planetary missions. 'It is the.first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said.Whittaker. Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have.developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them.were ever meant to leave Earth. 'What.Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into.rover.configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' Whittaker added. To find.the ice,.rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible,.but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said. Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture.light from low on the horizon. The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power. Polaris.also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion.robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's.rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the.long shadows and dark regions found at the poles. Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only.about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles. The Astrobotic team expects Polaris.could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and.characterizes water ice deposits. Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar.Prize of more than $20 million. Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers.total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon. First prize.$20m.will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land.robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.' If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely. Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during.three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The firm hopes to fund the development of its lunar landing by offering to take items.with prices ranging from $460 to $26,000.The capsules purchased will be placed on this Griffin Lander, which is expected to blast off on top of.space\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," By.Victoria Woollaston.The Yo app may have been criticised for being useless, but its brilliance was in its simplicity.

It was revealed on Saturday that hewas able to keep investigators in the dark  as the smell of the 400,000 pounds of Maraschino cherries his plant processed each week managed to mask the stench of the marijuana plants. Reports suggest he was capable of growing at least 100 at.time, but could have managed up to 1,200, meaning he could have been making substantially more from the criminal enterprise. Furthermore, the other red flag for authorities would have been the heightened electric bill from running grow lamps.something that was also masked by his large operation.

All that, along with 120 expensive grow lamps, were completely hidden, leading one source to speculate he could have been working alone and not with the help of others at the company. 'In theory, it could have been him and outsiders,' said the source. 'This is.secreted part of.large factory that was designed so.large number of employees won't know.'

But that isn't all, as they plan to make England their home for the remainder of the week. With.depleted linebacking corps and.worrying inability to score touchdowns, Dennis Allen's side are certainly down, but not necessarily out. And as the bleary-eyed squad familiarise themselves with their sumptuous Surrey surrounds, the Raiders finished their first practice on English soil in high spirits ahead of their home' game with the Miami Dolphins at Wembley on Sunday. Oakland Raiders head coach Dennis Allen gave his players some time off to recover from the jetlag.A Raiderette struts her stuff on Regent Street in central London this week.I thought practice was pretty good,' said head coach Allen. Obviously we got here Monday morning and the guys had.little bit of time on Monday and Tuesday to catch up on.little bit of rest. Now we'll get started with.normal game week preparation. 'I think the further we go into the week, the more acclimated the guys will get to the time change and hopefully that won't be any sort of factor come Sunday.' After arriving in these shores on Monday morning, quarterback Derek Carr spoke of the oddities of the international series. Oakland Raiders players prepare for.drill during training in Surrey on Wednesday.Quarterback Derek Carr is struggling to get his head around the time difference.It's crazy..texted my wife this morning and she was still on Tuesday..was texting her goodnight and she said \"good morning\".

'Obviously, still feeling it.little bit today. As the days have gone, it's gotten progressively better. The faster.can get into the right time zone, which is here, the better it will feel. I'm glad we came out as early as we did because it definitely makes.difference.' Devoid of two starters.wide receiver Rod Streater and safety Tyvon Branch suffered foot injuries during the agonising 16-9 defeat at New England.the Raiders know they need to win. And fast. Oakland Raiders brought their cheerleaders with them to London ahead of their Wembley clash.That's all.care about,' said rookie quarterback Carr. I've told you guys that I'll throw five touchdowns or five picks,.could care less..just want to win. That's all this game is about. That's all that matters in the NFL..learned that quick. As we saw last week, we score.touchdown, it gets taken away. We're going in there, who knows what could have happened after that. It's just that much. You learn how hard it is to win in this league and you learn how hard it is to get that first one. David Haye was presented with his own personalised Raiders shirt by Menelik Watson.'That's what I'm learning right now, how much it really takes to get one win, let alone 16, something that New England has done before. Hopefully we'll get it this week..don't make any promises,.can tell you that.' And Carr spoke in glowing terms of the explosive Cameron Wake..can go on and on on their whole defense. They have so much talent. Cameron Wake is obviously.great player. You have to knowâ€¦ when you turn the film on, you're like \"oh my goodness, who is 91?\" It's one of those guys. You've got to know where he's at at all times.' Khali Mack (left) is hoping for an improved performance against Miami Dolphins at the weekend.Meanwhile Khalil Mack, the fifth overall pick of May's draft, was succinct about the Raiders' fortunes so far.

They like to pressure the quarterback. 'They've done.great job of getting pressure on the quarterback so we've got to understand what they're trying to do.

Suzanne Barr, chief of staff to ICE Director John Morton, said in her resignation letter that the allegations against her are 'unfounded.' But she said she was stepping down anyway to end distractions within the agency. ICE,.division of the Homeland Security Department, confirmed Barr had resigned. The Associated Press obtained.copy of Barr's letter. Barr is accused of sexually inappropriate behavior toward employees. The complaints are related to.sexual discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by.senior ICE agent in May.In her letter to Morton, Barr said she has been the subject of 'unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation' and is resigning 'with great regret.' 'Of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,' Barr wrote. Former boss: Barr had been chief of staff for John Morton, pictured, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.'As such,.feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work.' Barr went on leave last month after the New York Post reported on the lawsuit filed by James T. Hayes Jr., ICE's special agent in charge in New York. Additional employees came forward with their allegations around the same time. In one complaint, Barr is accused of telling.male subordinate he was 'sexy' and asking.personal question about his anatomy during an office party. In.separate complaint, she is accused of offering to perform.sex act with.male subordinate during.business trip in Bogota, Colombia. She's also accused of calling.male subordinate from her hotel room and offering to perform.sex act. The names of two of Barr's accusers were censored in affidavits reviewed by AP. Homeland Security's office of professional responsibility and inspector general have been investigating the allegations. Prior to the lawsuit, there were no complaints about Barr, according to.homeland security official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Denial: The suit does not outline the nature of the relationship. Napolitano, pictured, has denied she is gay.In the lawsuit, Hayes described.'frat house' atmosphere at ICE designed to humiliate male employees under Barr's leadership. James.Hayes Jr, the head of the New York ICE office, filed.discrimination lawsuit against Napolitano earlier this year. The latest affidavits have been submitted to his attorney.Hayes, who was transferred to New York from ICE headquarters in Washington, is asking for more than $4million that, among other things, would cover compensation he believes he is owed for relocation expenses and financial losses associated with his transfer. Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Silver Spring, Maryland, has declined to comment. The Justice Department is seeking to dismiss Hayes' lawsuit on the basis that he did not state.claim for retaliation. Barr,.1995 graduate of the University of Arizona, was among Napolitano's first appointments after she became secretary in 2009. Barr started working for Napolitano in 2004, while Napolitano was governor of Arizona. Prior to that, Barr worked for Arizona Republican Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain. In one of the new affidavits, an ICE employee claims Barr said to.senior executive, 'You.sexy m*****-f*****'. It continued: 'She then looked at his crotch and asked, \"How long is it anyway?\" Several employees laughed nervously.'

The footage, shot by animals rights group Mercy for Animals last month, shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm in Greenleaf, beating the cows and dragging them with ropes from tractors.leaving them with gaping, bleeding wounds. NestlÃ©, who owns DiGiorno frozen pizza, confirmed today that they will no longer use any use cheese for their pizza from any firm supplied with milk by Wiese Brothers.as it emerged that the Wisconsin firm has fired two staff and that police are investigating the family firm. Scroll Down for Video.Sick: The animal rights group Mercy For Animals released the video on Tuesday.

They confirmed that they have instructed their cheese supplier, Foremost Farms USA, that NestlÃ© 'will not accept any cheese made with milk from the Wiese Brothers Farm.' After viewing the horrific video which shows cows hanging from ropes and blistered with seeping sores, Foremost Farms USA declared themselves to be 'extremely disappointed.' 'To protect consumer trust and confidence in the dairy industry, we have discontinued receiving milk from the farm depicted in the video.' Horrible: This cow is bleeding heavily from an open wound and is not being treated by any employee at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin.Grim: Another cow is hoisted into the air while at Griese Brothers and frantically runs its legs to try and escape.Faced with.public relations disaster, the Wiese family said that they were 'shocked and saddened' at the footage and added they have 'zero tolerance for animal abuse.' They confirmed that the two employees seen in the video had been fired and.third removed from 'animal handling' responsibilities. 'Further action will be taken if the investigation warrants it,' said the statement. The local sheriff's department in Greenleaf said that they are investigating the alleged abuse and will be pressing charges if warranted. The video was shot undercover by.representative of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals in October and November and was then handed over to NBC News. Cruel: This cow is hanging in the air as.forklift truck operated by an employee reverses backwards.Poked pulled and prodded: This cow looks distressed as it is pulled by its head upwards by.tractor.'No socially responsible corporation should support dairy operations that beat, kick, mutilate and neglect animals,' said MFA's executive director, Nathan Runkle. 'Due to its complete lack of meaningful animal welfare standards, DiGiorno has allowed.culture of cruelty to flourish in its cheese supply chain.' The gruesome video reveals repeated examples of cruelty towards the livestock at Wiese Brothers farm as bleeding animals are beaten with sticks or kicked and dragged by their legs or necks. Speaking to NBC News, one livestock expert said the video showed unequivocal evidence of abuse. 'Dragging live cows, and completely suspending them with the cow lift is severe animal abuse,' said Temple Grandin, an associate professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University and an animal welfare adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reality: This calf has been separated from its mother and could possibly be killed for veal at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin.'The actions of these people went beyond rough handling and escalated to the level of cruelty. Kicking, beating, and hard whipping of downed cows is abusive.' Brown County Shefiff's Department said they were in the midst of an investigation after being handed the footage. 'It something we're looking into right now,' said Captain David Konrath. 'At the conclusion of the investigation we'll give the case to the district attorney and he will make.decision about whether charges would be filed.' Pizza and the farm: DiGiorno is the most popular brand of pizza in the United States and the milk its cheese suppliers use comes from Wiese Brothers.A Wiese family spokesperson said that they were working fully with Brown County Sheriff's Department and had invited an 'independent animal care auditor from.national evaluation firm' to come to their facility and begin.review of practices within 24 hours of being made aware of the footage in on November 26. 'We are shocked and saddened to see.few of our employees not following our farm's policies for proper animal care. We have zero tolerance for animal abuse. We are committed to providing optimal care and ask all our employees to demonstrate ongoing respect for every animal at all times,' the farm said. The farm, which has 4,500 cows that produce about 350,000 pounds of milk daily, was chosen at random to investigate.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Nestl, who owns DiGiorno frozen pizza, confirmed today that they will no longer use any cheese for their pizza from any firm supplied with milk by Wiese Brothers.As it emerged that the Wisconsin firm has fired two staff and that police are investigating\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Sharp-eyed viewers criticised the first series of Downton Abbey when latter day sights including.TV aerial intruded into its Edwardian scenes.

The coach is still battling to save his job and he picked his strongest possible side with Messi, Neymar and Luis Suarez reunited up front.all three scored in the first half to all but put Barca in the quarter-finals where they will face thee winner of the Madrid derby between Atletico and Real after the formality of next week's second leg. Many Barcelona supporters were left asking why tinkerman Enrique had rested Gerard Pique, Dani Alves, Ivan Rakitic, Neymar and Messi in the previous Sunday's difficult trip to Real Sociedad to then play them all against lowly Elche who are currently the worst side in Spanish football.

Booked: Suarez, Roco, Pelegrin. Referee: David Fernandez.Att: 27,099.Suarez looked especially inspired, assisting the first and scoring the second, meaning he now has goals in all three competitions for the club he joined this summer. Barcelona were both unlucky and wasteful in the first half hour. Neymar should have been awarded.penalty when he was bounced off the ball by Damian Suarez but the referee waved away the appeals. Then.perfect lofted pass from Messi dropped into Neymar's path. The Brazilian should have scored without breaking stride but he sent his shot wide. Neymar was all flicks and tricks against Elche's five-man defence and on 35 minutes he was given another chance and this time he didn't miss, hammering home Suarez's slide-rule pass across the face of the six-yard box. Suarez could have opened his account on 38 minutes but his lob was finger-tipped away by Elche keeper PrzemysÅ‚aw Tyton. The former Liverpool striker was working hard though and he created an opening for himself just before half-time before drilling home the Barca second. Neymar was then tripped on the stroke of half-time and Messi scored the penalty, before blowing.kiss to supporters who were making it clear who they backed in the power struggle between coach and star player. Suarez was involved again 10 minutes into the second half, passing to Messi who threaded.pass through Elche's defence to Jordi Alba, who made it 4-0. And it was five when Neymar rifled in right-footed from the edge of the area. The Brazilian was kicked by Damian Suarez and taken off as.precaution but it's.measure of  Enrique's popularity-low at the moment that his decision to bring on Adriano was booed by many fans.

Most people could probably name.Scottish or Irish author, but how about.Polish one? Readers who are not Polish or of Polish descent face.few obstacles to opening the rich and different world of Polish literature. Firstly, Poland is not.world player, and we tend to become interested in.country's culture only when it is.global power or.real or possible threat to us. Secondly there is the spelling and pronouncing of names. We can handle the Russian transliteration of Gregory as Grigory. But the Polish for Gregory, alas, is Grzegorz. All those z's. (I played Scrabble with.friend in Warsaw:.player gets one point for.Z.) Obstacle three is that the jewel in the crown of Polish literature is its poetry, and unfortunately poetry is what usually gets lost in translation (though the translations have been improving). However it's worth facing and overcoming these obstacles, because the Polish way of looking at the world has plenty to teach us. If Polish literature began in the Renaissance it blossomed in mid-19th century Romanticism. The Shakespeare of Polish Romanticism was the poet Adam Mickiewicz. His \"Pan Tadeusz,\".novel in verse, restores.lost world through the magic of art. There is dalliance, swordplay, music,.hunt -- but even.humble vegetable patch delights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Polish poetry and drama took.turn towards the avant-garde. The poetry had been remarkable from the beginning, but Cyprian Norwid,.contemporary of Emily Dickinson (his verse is strikingly similar to her quiet, difficult lyricism), showed the way to modern understatement. Check out Zbigniew Herbert and Poland's Nobel laureate WisÅ‚awa Szymborska. Absurdism and dark humor are Polish specialties and appear in the playful stories and novels of Witold Gombrowicz. Lovers of science fiction should know StanisÅ‚aw Lem..KrakÃ³w native, Lem became internationally known for \"Solaris,\" (which gave rise to two films, one by Andrei Tarkovsky and.Hollywood version by Steven Soderbergh), satirical fantasy \"The Cyberiad,\" and essays on humanity and future technology. His work is marked by fun, pain, and.probing intelligence. READ MORE: Poland's tangible heritage.All these poets, playwrights, novelists, and essayists write about the human condition, but there has always been.political element to most Polish literature;.consequence of growing up in.country with.history of partition and repeated defeat. Poland was.major European power during the 17th and 18th centuries. However weak kings and lack of organization led to.political vacuum and the country ceased to exist without.fight in 1795 when Prussia, Austria, and Russia divided it up among themselves. Poland did not exist again as.state until after World War I. During that long period of nationlessness, poets and novelists strove to preserve Polish identity at home and abroad. Soldiers fought in other lands, hoping to make.future Poland possible; and young men periodically sacrificed themselves in uprisings that were crushed (1830, 1848, 1863). Poles became known for their idealism, their valor in the face of overwhelming odds, their splendid if suicidal recklessness, their patriotism, and -- understandably, given that over and over again this patriotism proved futile -- for their cynicism. The 20th century added another shadow to the Polish mind: the Holocaust; before World War II, Poland had the largest Jewish community in Europe. Poland fought with the Allies but \"in reward\" (a Polish smile of irony here) had to spend the next fifty years behind the Iron Curtain. Irony is not unique to Polish writers but they are masters of it. It's telling that an American writer much loved in Poland today is Philip K. Dick, who felt that the world was against him..offer an emblematic moment in Polish literature..much loved author to Poles is Henryk Sienkiewicz. In \"With Fire and Sword,\".historical novel set in the mid-17th century, the soldier Longinus PodbipiÄ™ta reminds us of Don Quixote. He has taken.vow of chastity and he may not pursue the object of his affections until he has cut off three enemy heads with.single blow of his enormous Crusader's sword. He manages that but then, without hesitation, offers himself up to martyrdom. The mix of humor, bitterness, and religious faith: very Polish.

Shortly afterward, numerous networks and newspapers picked them up, sparking the controversy that continued once the remarks were broadcast. Friday evening, Duncan called New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant, his office said. Duncan said Tuesday that he regrets what he said but insisted that the storm motivated the city to reinvest in its children like never before. \"I said it poorly. And my point was very simple. Hurricane Katrina was.devastating, devastating tragedy. The progress we've seen subsequent to that has been absolutely remarkable. The teachers, the principals there are working so incredibly hard,\" Duncan said. \"Almost all the students missed three months, four months, six months..talked to students who missed more than.year off school, and yet they came back. And in.short amount of time, four years, they came back, subsequent to the devastating tragedy. Amazing progress. And.just tip my hat to the hard work there..was simply trying to point out how impressed.am, the remarkable commitment and the sense of urgency.\" Several Louisiana officials defended Duncan's remarks. The state's superintendent of education, Paul Pastorek, said, \"I know it's.strong statement, but it's actually quite accurate. It was.pathetic system before the storm.\" Paul Vallas, superintendent of the Louisiana Recovery School District --.special program administered by the state with the aim of boosting underperforming schools -- noted that \"local people have said that time and time again.\" Duncan said in the TV One interview that New Orleans in the past \"was not serious about its education\" but called the school system's reform since Katrina \"unbelievable.\" Duncan has made several trips to New Orleans since becoming education secretary one year ago.

But as the years go by, the high-stakes decisions, constant criticisms and the fluctuating public opinion chip away at the president. His shoulders slump.little and his energy may seem sapped. The president ages twice as fast while in office, according to.theory advanced by Dr. Michael Roizen,.chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. \"The typical person who lives one year ages one year,\" he said.  \"The typical president ages two years for every year they are in office.\" Using public information, Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt. Assessing factors such as diet, blood pressure, physical activity and lifestyle habits, he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly. Roizen, who is the author of \"RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?\" has not assessed the \"real age\" of President-elect Barack Obama, who is 47, because of lack of medical data. \"Barack Obama is.fairly young guy and doesn't have great of.risk,\" Roizen said.  \"If he's president for eight years, he ends up having the risk of disability or dying, like someone who is 16 years older.\" Former president Bill Clinton entered the office with.robust head of salt-and-pepper hair and.healthy habit of running.

He was joking and incredibly quick-witted about current events. When he left office, he was hunched over. The age signs on face was there. His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events,\" he said.  See the toll of the presidency Â».On Wednesday, Obama, President George W. Bush, and all three living former presidents -- Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Clinton -- are meeting in the Oval Office and then having lunch together at the White House. After eight draining years in the Oval Office, an outgoing president like George W. Bush can reverse the tolls of stress by exercising and spending time with friends, Roizen says. \"Do as many healthy things as you can adopt,\" Roizen suggested.  \"The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do.\" During his second term, Bush dealt with.troubled war,.struggling economy, and sagging approval ratings.  But the avid runner, mountain biker and fisherman showed that his reflexes haven't slowed. \"I mean, did you see him dodge that shoe?\" said David Zinczenko, editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, referring to.December news conference in Iraq where an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president and Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear.

Scans of fossil teeth show the short and gangly South African Australopithecus sediba lived on.hard diet of trees, bushes and fruit two million years ago.similar to.chimpanzee. But virtually all other ancient human ancestors from Africa tucked into softer meals of grasses and sedges.even the 'Nutcracker Man', Paranthropus boisei, with his massive jaws and teeth. An analysis of the teeth of the short, gangly hominin australopithecus sediba shows it had.diet unlike virtually all of our other known ancestors.A. sediba had an upright posture and long arms, and embodied characteristics of both primitive and modern hominids.including.human-like ankle, short fingers and.long thumb for possible precision gripping and.relatively complex brain compared to earlier hominids. Researchers made the discovery by zapping fossilised teeth with.laser, which frees carbon from the enamel.allowing scientists to find the types of plants consumed and environments where the hominids lived. Although bark and woody tissues had not been documented as.dietary component of any other ancient African hominids before, these foods had been scoffed by many contemporary primates and contain both protein and soluble sugars. The diet of A. sediba also may have been similar to that of today's African savanna chimpanzees. The researchers also discovered microscopic, fossilised particles of plant tissue called phytoliths trapped in ancient tooth tartar.a hardened form of dental plague. University of Colorado Boulder doctoral student Paul Sandberg said: The fact that these phytoliths are preserved in the teeth of 2-million-year-old hominids is remarkable and speaks to the amazing preservation at the site. Boning up on the facts:.right hand skeleton of Australopithecus sediba superimposed against.modern human hand.Remarkable find: One of two sets of bones from Australopithecus Sediba are unveiled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg this week.Ancient: Scientists say the bones are 1.977million years old.The phytolith data suggest the A. sediba individuals were avoiding the grasses growing in open grasslands that were abundant in the region at the time.It is an important finding because diet is one of the fundamental aspects of an animal, one that drives its behaviour and ecological niche. As environments change over time because of shifting climates, animals are generally forced to either move or to adapt to their new surroundings. What fascinates me is that these individuals are oddballs..had pretty much convinced myself that after.million years ago most of our hominid kin had diets that were different from living apes, but now.am not so sure. And while our sample is too small to be conclusive, the rate at which Malapa is spewing hominid fossils makes me reasonably certain we won't have to wait another two million years to augment our data set.'

They then found developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. The research was revealed in.a paper presentedâ€”and awarded the prestigious Ken Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Awardâ€”at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. Jason Nieh, professor of computer science at Columbia Engineering, and PhD candidate Nicolas Viennot said they were stunned by the scale of their find. 'Google Play has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads, but no one reviews what gets put into Google Playâ€”anyone can get.$25 account and upload whatever they want. Very little is known about what's there at an aggregate level,' says Nieh.'Given the huge popularity of Google Play and the potential risks to millions of users, we thought it was important to take.close look at Google Play content.' Nieh and Viennot's paper is the first to make.large-scale measurement of the huge Google Play marketplace. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. PlayDrone scales by simply adding more servers and is fast enough to crawl Google Play on.daily basis, downloading more than 1.1 million Android apps and decompiling over 880,000 free applications. Google Play, the Android app store, has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads.Nieh and Viennot discovered all kinds of new information about the content in Google Play, including.critical security problem: developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. These vulnerabilities can affect users even if they are not actively running the Android apps. Nieh claims that even \"Top Developers,\" designated by the Google Play team as the best developers on Google Play, included these vulnerabilities in their apps. 'We've been working closely with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other service providers to identify and notify customers at risk, and make the Google Play store.safer place,' says Viennot. 'Google is now using our techniques to proactively scan apps for these problems to prevent this from happening again in the future.' In fact, Nieh adds, developers are already receiving notifications from Google to fix their apps and remove the secret keys.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The Columbia Engineering Team found thousands of secret keys in android apps that could be used to steal user data.The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security.They were then able to decompile\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Chelsea have re-opened talks with Atletico Madrid over their move to sign Filipe Luis.

The two sources offered slightly different versions of who knew what, when. The diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak publicly, said Pakistan knew about the heightened intelligence activity, specifically in the city of Abbottabad, but \"never, never had any idea the operation was about bin Laden.\" The diplomat was approached privately by.Pakistani to inquire about heightened U.S. intelligence-gathering activities. He said it was assumed Pakistan was asking all Arab allies. Meanwhile, the senior Pakistani official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters, said Pakistan was indeed aware of \"heightened CIA activity in Pakistan\" in the weeks prior to the raid, but that the information officials had was not \"Abbottabad specific.\" \"If folks in Islamabad had been able to pinpoint Abbottabad, they would have done something about it,\" the official said. Relations between Pakistan and the United States have been increasingly strained since bin Laden was killed in.Navy SEAL raid in early May. U.S. officials believe Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders. Washington did not give advance notice to Pakistani officials about the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. CIA Director Leon Panetta reportedly has told legislators that Pakistan was either involved in helping the world's most wanted fugitive avoid detection or was incompetent for not knowing he was living on Pakistani soil. The Arab diplomat said he is sure officials in Pakistan \"had no idea where bin Laden was.\" He also said \"it was always clear Zawahiri was going to replace bin Laden,\" referring to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to bin Laden who is thought to have taken over leadership of al Qaeda. \"It's not in their culture to go with someone else. They (al Qaeda) value loyalty,\" the diplomat said.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have.'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels. And he warned that the Conservative Party's approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in.generation'. David Cameron has promised that if he remains prime minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out'.raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. Today Labour warned business leaders they must start making the arguments against severing ties with Brussels. In.speech to ambassadors from all 28 EU member states, Mr Alexander said pro-EU business leaders should learn the lessons of the Scottish independence debate. Many companies delayed expressing.view until the last minute when polls suggest.Yes vote could win, but were then seen as playing.crucial role in shaping the final days of the campaign. Mr Alexander acknowledged that many business leaders are wary of getting involved in political debates. But he added: 'For business to speak up for Britain's place in Europe is not about party political advantage, it is about recognising both where our country's national interest and your business interests lies. 'It is about patriotic duty. And good business sense.' Leaving the EU would mean 'actively choosing an economy with weaker investment, less trade with the rest of the world, poorer productivity and worse living standards,' said Mr Alexander. He claimed Mr Cameron had become 'a much more marginal figure in Brussels', adding: 'Ukip is on the march, and David Cameron is running.' Last month the Prime Minister used his long-awaited immigration speech to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be.key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership. Issuing.direct appeal for other European countries who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent, he insisted his demands were not 'outlandish' and Britain deserves 'to be heard'. And he threatened to block any new countries joining the EU unless controls are imposed to stop their citizens flocking to more successful economies like Britain. But Mr Alexander warned that.Conservative victory in the 2015 election would mean that within the course of the next Parliament, Britain could be out of Europe and thrust into.'full-blown constitutional crisis'. 'The truth is that.Conservative government in 2015 would mean breaking not simply with the record of the last government, it would mean breaking with decades of history that have defined the country we are today, how our country is run, and the place we have in the world,' he said. 'That risk is real. And so too is the responsibility on business to now find its voice and to make the case with authority and passion, that the right road for Britain is not exit from Europe but reform within Europe.' David Cameron, pictured with pupils James Samur (centre) and George Bateman during.physics class at the Harris City Academy, has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU.The Prime Minister has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out'.raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way.In.message to the 'quiet majority' of UK business leaders who he said were concerned about EU exit, he added: 'Now is the time to speak out. Now is the time to speak up. Because you know what is most at stake. You know what we have to lose. Your voice must be heard, because if you wait, it could be too late.' Mr Alexander said that Labour would push for reform of the EU, rather than exit, arguing for the creation of.Council of the Single Market to defend the interests of non-eurozone members and for changes to competition rules to allow national governments to support firms at times of crisis. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: 'Manufacturers remain overwhelmingly of the view that our economic well-being and long term strategic interest of this country is dependent on being.full and leading player in the EU. Equally we do recognise that reform of the EU is also.key requirement. 'We do not want uncertainty on this subject. Jobs, investment and trade are all dependent on.thriving and effective EU, with Britain at its heart. That's what we all need to be striving to achieve.' Alisdair McIntosh, director of pro-reform pressure group Business for New Europe, said: 'The debate about our EU membership is about the national interest. Investment, growth and jobs are at stake. 'EU membership is particularly important to vital industries including aerospace, the automotive sector, engineering and pharmaceuticals. It also plays.crucial role in facilitating research and development. These areas are critical for jobs and competitiveness. Politicians and business leaders alike need to reflect this.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander says business leaders have.'patriotic duty' to make the case for Brussels.He warns that the Conservative Party's approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in.generation'\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," A former British boxing champion accused of helping two men flee to Syria to fight with Islamic State (ISIS) will stand trial in June.

Flight 79 took off from Heathrow Airport at.p.m. (10 a.m. ET), destined for Dallas, Texas, according to American Airlines' website. The Boeing 777-200 airliner made it over the United States, but not to its final destination. It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. She did not specify what the issue was. Its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at Tulsa's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. CT (7:30 p.m. ET). One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. That means the aircraft's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport's tarmac, according to Masvidal. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa. According to American's website, it should have Flight 79's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs Oklahoma at 10 p.m. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. For those keeping score at home, that amounts to 14 hours after Flight 79's passengers first took off from London.

Shoppers soon went on Twitter to vent their frustration. Belinda Moore,.communications director, wrote: 'You are kidding me! Whole delivery cancelled. There's not.snowflake in miles of London. So unimpressed.' She added: 'Can't wait to get home, get the kids to bed and then spend two hours doing the food shop.' Sandra Oliver was told to expect.delay of five hours before it was eventually cancelled. She wrote: 'Ridiculous that my shopping is late again tonight.it's becoming.regular occurrence these days.' Helen Bullock tweeted: 'Unacceptable service. Notified at 11.30pm that 9pm delivery would not be turning up. Second time now. Loyalty being challenged big time.'

They say primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops. The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council which represents medical schools all over the country, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study the subject. Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while.third were privately educated. Medicine is.very popular career choice, the guidance says, with fierce competition. 'Medical schools have worked hard so that they can attract the right candidates and to establish admissions processes which are fair to all,' it says. 'Yet it remains that more needs to be done to ensure that the medical profession is representative of the society it serves, and that medical students are able to learn in.diverse environment.' This is the first time that the council has published advice on how to widen access to medical courses. It suggests that the 'journey to medicine' should start in primary schools, an area which is sometimes overlooked by medical schools. Pupils should be told about the qualifications and routes to becoming.doctor, the guidance says, and take part in 'lively and fun' activities linked to the profession. This could include roadshows, campus visits, demonstrations and workshops. 'Medical students acting as ambassadors are often the best people to lead activity, which can include demonstrations, campus tours and mentoring,' it says. 'Some medical schools formally recognise this work by medical students as part of their educational development.' In secondary schools, students should be taught about studying medicine at university and what.career in the profession involves. This includes helping pupils make the right subject choices for their GCSEs, Scottish Nationals, A-levels and other qualifications. The guidance goes on to suggest that when pupils are in the sixth-form, medical schools could offer would-be students help in making applications, including support in writing personal statements and preparing for interviews and admissions tests. Experts said primary school pupils should have the chance to meet people working in medicine, visit universities and take part in practical medical and science workshops to help encourage them to train up.They could also run master classes and summer schools for secondary school pupils of all ages. Professor Tony Weetman, chair of the Selecting for Excellence Executive Group, said: 'A candidate's journey to.medical degree starts long before the Ucas application is made. 'The commitment in terms of hard work and academic achievement is of course essential, but before that must come the awareness that studying medicine is an option. 'That realisation does not come readily to all potential candidates, be they school students or mature learners, and we know that one's background will play.central part here. 'Medical schools cannot leave potentially excellent candidates to learn this message on their own; they have.responsibility, where possible, to reach out to these people and show them first-hand that.career in medicine is for anyone with the ability and commitment.' Professor Les Ebdon, director of Fair Access to Higher Education, said: 'This guidance represents.major development in helping to improve access to the elite medical profession. 'Going to medical school opens the door to.career in.rewarding, high-status profession and that door should be open to everyone who has what it takes to be an excellent doctor, regardless of their background.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The advice, published by the Medical Schools Council, comes amid concerns that youngsters from disadvantaged backgrounds are still much less likely to study medicine.Only two fifths of doctors attended non-selective state schools, while.third were privately educated.\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," There are more than 7,000 islands and reefs sprinkled throughout the Caribbean Sea. Isn't it time you explored some place new? We've unearthed six singular destinations where you can stake out your own quiet stretch of sand. Isla de Providencia, Colombia The residents of Providencia,.25-minute flight from neighboring San AndrÃ©s Island, make much of their association with Sir Henry Morgan, the 17th-century swashbuckler de picted on rum bottles worldwide. As well they should: Only.492-foot-long floating bridge separates Providencia from Santa Catalina, one of Morgan's favorite bases..quarter-mile hike to the top of Providencia's El Pico yields 360-degree views of pristine rain forests and of the area where Morgan hid his loot. Near Aguadulce Bay, Hotel El Pirata Morgan's 27 rooms have private balconies, many overlooking the pool (011-57/8-514-8232, from $62). About four miles away at Playa Manzanillo, Roland Roots Bar hosts beach parties with reggae music and drinks served in coconut shells (no phone, from $7.75). Comarca Kuna Yala, Panama One of Panama's largest indigenous groups, the Kuna people have lived on the Comarca Kuna Yala chain of more than 350 islands and coral cays since the 1600s. Kuna women make and sell molas, swatches of hand-embroidered cloth in vivid purples, reds, and blues that are typically made into garments. The men spend their days fishing for grouper and mackerel and leading visitors on boat trips to the archipelago's dozens of uninhabited islands, some barely 100 yards wide. Many hotels here offer immersive, all-inclusive experiences. At CabaÃ±as Uaguinega on Achutupu Island, 45 minutes from Panama City by air, the rate for.bamboo-walled, solar-powered cabin covers two tours or cultural outings daily and all meals (uaguinega.com, from $140 per person).

What the reef means for travelers is.lot more than great snorkeling; it protects some of the longest beaches in the British Virgin Islands and has also netted 200-plus shipwrecks, ripe for divers' explorations. Pomato Point Restaurant, on the southwest shore, is known as much for its museum of shipwreck artifacts as it is for its swordfish and conch dishes (284/495-9466, entrÃ©es from $20). At the nearby Neptune's Treasure hotel, paintings of boats on stormy seas hang in the nine rooms, set about 150 feet from the water (neptunestreasure.com, from $95). Terre-de-Haut, Guadeloupe You could be forgiven.double take upon arriving at Terre-de-Haut,.45-minute ferry ride from Grande-Terre, Guadeloupe: It's like.slice of northwestern France, with goats nibbling scrubby plants on the hillsides and.culture steeped in the ways of early settlers from Brittany.

Even the 12 guest rooms at Auberge Les Petits Saints are decorated with French antiques (petitssaints.com, from $131). But it's not all about old times.cosmopolitan yachting crowd regularly drops anchor (and their swimsuits) at the west coast's Anse Crawen beach.

Eventually, the 60-foot long rocket plane will be taken 60,000 feet above the Earth by its carrier and fire rockets to propel itself into space. The test-flight program is expected to continue through 2011, going first to.free glide and then to.powered flight before commercial flights begin. \"Seeing the finished spaceship in December was.major day for us but watching VSS Enterprise fly for the first time really brings home what beautiful, ground-breaking vehicles Burt and his team have developed for us,\" Branson said. \"Today was another major step along that road and.testament to U.S. engineering and innovation,\" he said.

Narrating the video, the.Revolutionary Guard's air space chief, General Amir Ali Hajizadeh, says.in one part that only after Iran captured the drone did it realise it 'belongs to the CIA.' Iranian officials have said the drone.came down over eastern Iran in December 2011, hundreds of miles from the cluster of.nuclear sites in the central and north-west of the country.

'This aircraft has carried out many operations in the countries around Iran,' the narrator says. 'In the operations taken place in Pakistan, this aircraft guided many of the clashes ... Iran believes it can 'mass produce' the captured drone by 'reverse engineering' the aircraft. When the drone went missing President Obama made it clear the U.S. wanted the top-secret aircraft back. 'We have asked for it back. We'll see how the Iranians respond,' Obama said during.White House news conference. But in.later interview Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made it clear his country would not grant the U.S. request. Graphic: The RQ-170 was reportedly used to watch former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden during the Navy SEAL mission that killed him.'The Americans have perhaps decided to give us this spy plane,' Ahmadinejad said. 'We now have control of this plane.' Speaking through an interpreter, Ahmadinejad said: 'There are people here who have been able to control this spy plane, who can surely analyze this plane's system also. â€¦ In any case, now we have this spy plane.' At the time Obama wouldn't comment on what the Iranians might learn from studying the downed aircraft. Defense.Secretary Leon Panetta said it's difficult to know 'just frankly how.much they're going to be able to get from having obtained those parts.' Request: President Obama during.2011 White House news conference when he asked for the drone back.Panetta said the request to return the drone was appropriate. 'I don't expect that that will happen,' he said. 'But.think it's important to make that request.' Former U.S. Vice-President Dick Cheney blasted Mr Obama for his soft approach in trying to get the surveillance plane back, insisting he should have ordered an airstrike over Iran instead. He told CNN: 'The right response would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it. 'You can do that from the air and, in effect, make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone, but [Obama] asked nicely for them to return it, and they aren't going to.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," State television broadcast footage allegedly extracted from.CIA drone captured in 2011.The footage shows an aerial view of an airport and city, said to be Kandahar in Afghanistan.Tehran has long claimed it managed to reverse-engineer the R\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," By.Chris Wheeler.Follow @ChrisWheelerDM.Liverpool's penalty shootout win over Manchester City in New York will be little consolation for losing out in the Premier League title race on the final day of last season, but it gave some indication that Brendan Rodgers's side are set to be contenders again. Both sides are expected to line up quite differently on August 17 and made.number of changes throughout Wednesday's match, making it difficult to judge their pre-season progress. MailOnline looks at what we learned from the slug-out at Yankee Stadium â€¦.Scroll down for videos.First blood: Liverpool defeated Manchester City on penalties in the International Champions Cup friendly.Jordan Henderson and Philippe Coutinho impressed among the Liverpool starters and Raheem Sterling gave his side.much sharper attacking edge when he came on in the second half before scoring the late equaliser. It wasn't the best of days again for Steven Gerrard whose latest slip let in Stevan Jovetic for City's opening goal, but Rodgers has no doubt his skipper will be.key player in that deep-lying role again this season. We were unfortunate with the first goal that deflected off Stevie and Jovetic got.toe on it,' said the Liverpool boss. But he's been playing that role for the last 12 months and I'm sure he'll play it this season as well. He's got.wonderful range of pass, his movement is good to get on the ball and he's very committed.' Red leader: Steven Gerrard (C) is set to resume his deep lying position in midfield.Making up for lost time: Stevan Jovetic scored both of Manchester City's goals in normal time.It's early days but already Jovetic looks determined to make up for lost time after an injury-hit first season at City. The Montenegro international scored twice to take his total to two in four games on tour, and will be as good as new signing 12 months after arriving from Fiorentina for £22m. Joe Hart made three fantastic saves after coming on at half-time even though he was outshone by Simon Mignolet in the shootout. The Liverpool keeper kept out Yaya Toure's effort as the Ivorian made.subdued first appearance since threatening to quit the champions this summer. Liverpool changed formation and players so often it was hard to keep track. Rodgers may well settle for his midfield diamond again this season although it is clear he wants his side to be versatile as well. He said: We played two different formations -.4-4-2 diamond in the first half which refreshed the players from some of the work they had last season. At times we worked it well but it was good to see it. Second half it was more of.4-3-3 and then we changed again with 20 minutes to 4-2-3-1. Multi-talented: Philippe Coutinho's versaility gave Liverpool plenty of options with formations.Double salvo: Jovetic scores City's second goal but could do nothing to prevent them losing on penalties.We had.connection through Coutinho who played.lot from the sides and the top of the diamond. The last 20 minutes he played in behind Daniel Sturridge to connect midfield and the front men. That made passes shorter and the movement better.' City lined up in more of.conventional 4-4-2 formation with Edin Dzeko and James Milner their first World Cup players to make an appearance in the US, although Manuel Pellegrini will probably revert to his favoured 4-2-3-1 once the season starts. It will be interesting to see how new £12m signing Fernando fits in with Toure and Fernandinho occupying those defensive midfield slots last season. City certainly have more in reserve with David Silva, Samir Nasri and Alvaro Negredo among the unused substitutes at Yankee Stadium. They are also waiting to welcome back captain Vincent Kompany, Fernandinho and World Cup finalists Sergio Aguero, Pablo Zabaleta and Martin Demichelis, who report back on Monday. Super sub: Raheem Sterling made an impression after coming off the bench at the Yankees Stadium.In the family: City goalkeeper Joe Hart embraces brothers Kolo and Yaya Toure at full-time.The five players who arrived last Thursday, Hart, Milner, Yaya, Silva and Dzeko,.think that they will be ready for the Premier League,' said Pellegrini. We will with see the rest of the players who arrive next Monday. Can they be fit in 15 days? Maybe not all of them will do it.' Sterling made the biggest impact of Liverpool's substitutes, but Lucas Leiva supplied.sublime touch for Henderson to score their first goal and Mignolet emerged as the hero of the shootout. Both of the men in charge seemed happy enough with the evening's exertions, if not the quality of parts of the playing surface. Coach Rodgers was delighted with the way his team twice fought back from.goal down. Even though it was.pre-season game it was highly competitive,' he said. The players showed the character to keep going and come back. It was.really good game. We have to respect the quality we were playing against. City are.top side, one of the best teams in Europe.' Coach trip: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers (L) and Man City's Manuel Pellegrini (R) were generally pleased.Coach Pellegrini knows there is more to come from his squad but was satisfied with what he saw. It was.very useful game for both teams,' said the City boss. We are trying to prepare our team in the best way. We've had.very good pre-season with part of the team. We had another five players playing some minutes today. The rest of the squad arrive next week we are preparing well for the Community Shield and Premier League.' Liverpool still need to convince people that they can withstand the loss of Luis Suarez and re-establish themselves as title contenders this season. New signing Rickie Lambert wasted.gilt-edged chance in the first half and Daniel Sturridge was also subdued for long periods. Kolo Toure and Sebastian Coates started in central defence but some question if they can be trusted after defensive frailties cost Liverpool dear last season. Weak link: There were question marks over Kolo Toure's performance in central defence.City, meanwhile, need to complete the £32m signing of Eliaquim Mangala which has been dragging on since January. Despite signing Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Willy Caballero,.new centre-back was the priority and Mangala does not seem to be falling over himself to come to Manchester. Judging by the form of Kelechi Iheanacho on tour, City also need to sort out.work permit for the Nigerian teenager as soon as possible. Of the squad that turned up at Yankee Stadium, Scott Sinclair, Matija Nastasic, Micah Richards, Javi Garcia and Jack Rodwell could all be gone by the time the transfer window shuts.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Liverpool beat Manchester City 3-2 in the International Champions Cup friendly on Wednesday.Steven Gerrard's side are expected to line up quite differently on August 17.The Reds have made.number of changes throughout Wednesday's match, making it difficult to\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Incredible images showing the cratered surface of the moon are the first ever to be taken with.3D printed telescope.

Sharon Turner and Tracy White falsely logged that patients were discharged earlier than they really were because of targets that required them to be dealt with within four hours, it was said. Any staff who tried to disobey the senior nurses' orders were told that unless they lied, the hospital would get fined and they would get the sack, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. Accused: Nurses Tracy White, left, and Sharon Turner, right, who worked at scandal-hit Stafford Hospital ordered staff to fake casualty records to meet waiting time targets,.hearing was told.Employees are said to have regularly sworn in the presence of patients, with Turner allegedly racially abusing.junior Asian doctor by calling him 'Osama's mate' and asking if he had.bomb in his rucksack. Black patients were also sometimes allegedly made to wait longer than those of other ethnicities, the hearing was told. Whistleblower Helene Donnelly has claimed she was 'ostracised and had to endure constant bitchy comments' whenever she tried to insist on putting down the true times. She said: 'The demands by Sister White and Sister Turner would appear frequently, during almost every shift. 'Sister Turner and Sister White would.often demand.or my colleagues change the discharge times to avoid.. breach. They would frequently lie about discharge times, and pressurise.members of staff to lie.

'I believe everyone in A&E must have been aware of what was going on.even junior doctors. 'It is my opinion senior managers must have known staff were altering discharge times. There were gaps in the paperwork. 'To.me, falsifying patient records seemed insane..was told, in no.uncertain terms, if we did not meet targets heads would roll. 'I was concerned about the terrible consequences our actions would have on patient care.' She claimed senior nurses 'would use scaremongering tactics to make us comply' with their orders to fake records. 'They would tell us if we had.patient in breach we could lose our jobs.' The.panel heard some patients were inappropriately sent on to other.departments in the hospital without being properly assessed, or even if.A&E staff knew there were no available beds there. Mrs Donnelly said sometimes staff were in such.rush to get patients out of casualty within four hours that staff 'left patients to lie in soiled sheets to meet the targets.' Recounting one occasion where she was scathingly told off by another manager for faking.discharge time, she said she looked at the paperwork and recognised White's handwriting. But the senior nurse did not come forward to admit the forgery was hers, the panel heard. 'I realised Sister White would have been happy for me,.junior nurse, to taker the blame for her actions,' said Mrs Donnelly. 'As.result of this, absolutely nothing happened to Sister White in terms of disciplinary action.' Both Turner and White were eventually subjected to an internal disciplinary inquiry in 2008, but they were later reinstated with no action taken against them.

There is renewed talk of creating safe havens and humanitarian corridors inside the country. And those demanding tougher measures are again asking why events in Syria should not prompt Libyan-style intervention by NATO and its Arab allies. In Washington Tuesday, Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said the United States \"should consider all options, including arming the opposition. The blood-letting has got to stop.\" So far, the international community's response to the violence in Syria has been limited. There has been diplomatic censure, with envoys withdrawn or \"recalled for consultations,\" and Syrian ambassadors expelled from several Arab states..growing raft of sanctions is draining the Syrian regime's coffers but only gradually sapping its strength. This is not.country that has relied on international trade for its survival. An Arab League monitoring mission is in abeyance, after.much criticized few weeks on the ground that drew ridicule even from within its own ranks and fury (for its perceived complacency) from protesters. And back in November, France floated the idea of humanitarian corridors that would be protected by armed observers -- while ruling out military intervention. So far the idea has not gained traction. None of this amounts to the sort of pressure that will make the al-Assad regime buckle, especially when it perceives as divided both internal opposition and the international community. Compare the situation to that in Libya -- almost.year ago. As then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi was about to unleash his forces on the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, the world came together in the shape of the U.N. Security Council to authorize international intervention and prevent.bloodbath. The French and British were prime movers behind U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973; the United States an enthusiastic supporter. Russia abstained, but at the time its ambassador noted that many questions remained \"unanswered, including how it would be enforced and by whom, and what the limits of engagement would be.\" Russian later complained that.humanitarian mandate had become.blank check in support of the rebels. Perhaps in part because of the bad blood over Libya, the world body has reached no similar consensus over Syria. Rather, the opposite, with some of the harshest diplomatic language traded for years. To the United States, the vetoes were.\"travesty.\" German ambassador Peter Wittig essentially said that Moscow and Beijing had Syrian blood on their hands. \"China and Russia will now have to assume that responsibility in the face of the international public opinion and especially in the Arab world, the Arab citizens and, of course, in face of the Syrian people,\" Wittig said. Beyond the rhetoric, the vetoes had.more practical consequence. NATO officials have made it clear that the alliance cannot act, by enforcing.no-fly zone for example, without U.N. support. Writer Derek Flood, recently in Syria with elements of the Free Syrian Army, says NATO officials envision no role for the alliance in Syria this year. But they have not ruled out.\"coalition of the willing\" outside the NATO orbit. Both Russia and China are wary of any international action supporting protest against authoritarian rule. And Syria has been first the Soviet Union's -- and now Russia's -- key ally in the region after Egypt 'defected' in the 1970s. As it has for decades, Russia still supplies the Syrian government with weapons. One Russian analyst, Ruslan Pukhov, told CNN: \"Once the Assad regime vanishes, we have zero influence in the region.\" According to Andrew Tabler of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, al-Assad has ably judged the \"diplomatic red lines\" to keep Moscow onside. There have been no massacres on the scale of what happened in Hama 30 years ago (when thousands were killed after.brief uprising against his father's rule) that might have forced Russia into.corner. The persistent drip of civilian casualties over almost.year has not unleashed.tide of irresistible outrage. Last weekend's casualties in Homs, which opposition activists said numbered in the hundreds, may have changed that. But what can be done? In Bosnia, the international community declared \"safe havens\" for Muslims but failed to protect them. The result in July 1995 was Srebrenica, the worst massacre in Europe since 1945, when some 8,000 Bosnian Muslim civilians were killed by Serb forces. Havens are only safe when protected against superior forces. Others support Sen. John McCain in arguing for arming the fledgling Free Syrian Army. Anne-Marie Slaughter, professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, told CNN that is \"the most likely [option], that the Arab League countries, Turkey and probably NATO as well arms the Free Syrian Army, gives them the means to fight back. \"But then you've got.long and bloody civil war,\" Slaughter says -- reminiscent of Bosnia. Analysts say that even setting aside the lack of international will, successful intervention in Syria would pose problems not present in Libya:.Geography: Most regime targets in Libya were close to the Mediterranean coast and within easy reach of NATO air bases in Italy. Even so, NATO warplanes flew some 21,000 missions over nearly six months to enforce the no-fly zone, suppress air defenses and destroy command centers and armor. Military analysts say that, while no match for the best NATO members could summon, Syrian armed forces are better equipped and coordinated than anything Gadhafi could muster. Neighboring states: Few of Syria's neighbors would likely allow their territory to be used to pre-position supplies or military units. Certainly neither Iraq nor Lebanon, both countries with their own volatile sectarian mixes. The Hezbollah militia, strongly allied with Syria, remains powerful within Lebanon. The presence of foreign troops on Jordanian soil might have repercussions for.monarchy that already has plenty of problems domestically. Using Israeli territory would send the wrong message altogether. That leaves Turkey,.NATO member that has run out of patience with al-Assad. Last month, the Turkish foreign minister compared the Syrian president with former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, and on Tuesday Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan warned al-Assad -- pointedly in Arabic -- \"What goes around, comes around.\" Turkey has military bases (Incirlik, Diyarbakir) close to the border that -- theoretically -- could serve as staging posts for intervention. But even for the Turks, there would be risks -- including.flood of refugees and possible retaliation by Damascus supporting the Kurdish terrorist group active in Turkey, the PKK. Topography: Libya was flat desert; there was little cover for regime forces and most of the fighting was along.narrow coastal strip. \"Target acquisition\" was relatively simple. Syria's physical geography is more challenging; and much of its northern border with Turkey and Lebanon is mountainous, with few major roads. Getting aid into any safe havens within Syria would be.logistical nightmare. The opposition: The Libyan rebels, for all their military shortcomings, quickly grabbed.swathe of eastern Libya and major air and seaports in Benghazi and Tobruk that became their resupply hubs. The Free Syrian Army (FSA), at best, controls.few neighborhoods in Homs and elsewhere. 'The FSA has established very small slices of liberated territory,\" says Derek Flood, who has just left Idlib province close to the Turkish border. He says the FSA is poorly armed; he was told the price of weapons on the black market has soared, \"with.used AK-47 fetching as much as $2,000.$3,000.\" Flood says the FSA in that area wants.5 kilometer buffer zone inside Syria to provide protection from regime forces. Crucially, the regime retains control of Syria's frontiers, and its armed forces appear cohesive, according to analysts in the region. There have been military defections, mainly of low-rank conscripts, but not of entire units with their armor. Against all this and the political risks of western military action in yet another Muslim country, some argue there is.moral imperative -- as there was in Libya and Kosovo (done), Rwanda (ignored) and Bosnia (eventually.) Writing last month in The Atlantic, Steven Cook argued: \"If there is no intervention and political will to stop Assad's crimes remains absent, the world will once again have to answer for standing on the sidelines of.mass murder.\" Cook --.senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations -- asked: \"At what point in the body count is international intervention deemed to be an acceptably worthwhile option that can have.positive effect on the situation? After Assad has killed 6,000 people? 7,000? 10,000? 20,000?\" Scholar Fouad Ajami agrees, telling CNN's Anderson Cooper: \"Not just the Russians and Chinese, shame to the rest of us. There's abdication elsewhere, by the Turks nearby, abdication by the Arab League and Washington. Washington spent an enormous amount of time chasing after the false mirage [that] maybe we can get the Russians and Chinese on board.\" Some also argue that, despite the price, there would also eventually be.strategic gain:.post-al-Assad Syria would unlikely be as close to Iran as is the current regime and might also deprive Hezbollah of critical regional support. Others see the risks of international intervention as outweighing any benefits, with the danger that civil war would inevitably spill into Lebanon. In an interview with CNN's Wolf Blitzer Tuesday, U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Susan Rice preferred tighter and more coordinated sanctions, saying that \"our strong preference is not to fuel what has the potential to become.full-blown civil war\" by arming the opposition. Diplomats expect.new \"contact group\" on Syria to involve at least the United States, France, the Arab League and Turkey. \"We think that the Assad regime is on its last legs, that the pressure is increasing, the economy is crumbling,\" Rice said. Syrians may already be discounting direct intervention by the West. In one YouTube video uploaded Tuesday from Homs,.doctor pleads for help from abroad. But he directs his message to the leaders of Turkey, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," NEW: Sen.

Polaris is.robotic rover with.lunar drill, oven, and instruments for analyzing volatiles that will be delivered to the Moon's surface on Astrobotic's lunar lander. The lander guides the spacecraft into lunar orbit and controls descent to the surface. The lander delivers 262 kg of payload to any destination on the Moon to support robotic lunar missions like skylight exploration, sample return, regional prospecting, and polar volatile characterization. Polaris will have.drill capable of getting.metre under the lunar surface to look for sign of ice.Polaris prospects for water at the lunar poles. Polaris has vertical solar panels to generate 250W of power and two radiator panels to reject excess heat. Stereo cameras and laser are used to guide Polaris and generate 3-D video and models of the lunar surface. The robot communicates directly with Earth using.pointed S-band antenna to receive commands and send video and data. Polaris carries up to 80kg of payload, such as.drill to take core samples and science instruments to identify water content. Polaris is capable of driving and avoiding obstacles autonomously, including traverses into dark regions in the lunar pole's long shadows. Polaris' suspension maintains four-wheel ground contact over sloped and rocky lunar terrain without the use of springs. The robot will explore for ten days until the 14-day cryogenic lunar night begins, then hibernate, recover at sunrise, and continue to explore. The lander and rover are both built to tolerate this cryogenic cold. The life sized working prototype of the Polaris rover that could mine the moon in 2015.The Polaris rover is.½ feet tall,.feet wide and.almost.feet long. It can move at about.foot.second on.2-foot-diameter composite wheels. Its suspension will enable the rover to rise up over rough.terrain, but also lower itself to the ground to perform drilling. The.rover will weigh 150 kilograms, or about 330 pounds, and can accommodate.a drill and science payload of up to 70 kilograms. Polaris is.first of its kind solar-powered robot that will search for potentially rich deposits of water ice on the moon. Observations.by NASA and Indian spacecraft suggest that.substantial amount of.water ice could exist at the lunar poles. That ice could be.source of.water, fuel and oxygen for future expeditions, researchers say. Polaris.can bore one meter into the lunar surface and.can operate in lunar regions characterized by dark, long shadows and.. sun that hugs the horizon. It has been developed for an expedition to.the moon's northern pole that would launch from Cape Canaveral on top of.. SpaceX Falcon.launch vehicle. Polaris.is.flight prototype but has the same configuration as the rover that.will eventually land on the moon. It includes.number of flight-worthy.components, including wheels and chassis beams constructed of light, but.tough composite materials. This.will enable Astrobotic team members to spend the coming months testing.and improving the robot's computer vision, navigation and planning.software, and software that can plot the rover's position on the moon.within 10 feet. The Polaris rover will hunt for ice on the moon that can be mined to help set up moon bases for future explorers.Astrobotic.—led by CMU's William 'Red' Whittaker.—develops robotics technology for planetary missions. 'It is the.first rover developed specifically for drilling lunar ice' said.Whittaker. Other robots built by the Field Robotics Center have.developed technologies necessary for lunar drilling, but none of them.were ever meant to leave Earth. 'What.Polaris does is bring those many ideas together into.rover.configuration that is capable of going to the moon to find ice,' Whittaker added. To find.the ice,.rover must operate as close to the dark poles as possible,.but not so far that it can't use solar arrays for power, Whittaker said. Polaris has three large solar arrays, arranged vertically to capture.light from low on the horizon. The solar arrays will be capable of an average of 250 watts of electrical power. Polaris.also makes use of software, pioneered in CMU's NASA-funded Hyperion.robot, that keeps track of the rover's position relative to the sun's.rays to maximize solar energy and husbands battery power for use in the.long shadows and dark regions found at the poles. Whittaker said the lunar day lasts about 14 Earth days, though only.about 10 days are suitable for water prospecting at the poles. The Astrobotic team expects Polaris.could drill 10 to 100 holes during that time as it locates and.characterizes water ice deposits. Astrobotic, in partnership with CMU, is also vying for the Google Lunar.Prize of more than $20 million. Polaris is one of two Moon rovers under development by Astrobotic in competition for the Google contest, which offers.total of $30m in awards to privately funded projects exploring the Moon. First prize.$20m.will be awarded to the company that can 'safely land.robot on the surface of the Moon, have that robot travel 500 meters over the lunar surface, and send video, images and data back to the Earth.' If Polaris successfully survives the long, frigid lunar nights, as anticipated, the prospecting mission could be extended indefinitely. Astrobotic has won nine lunar contracts from NASA worth $3.6 million, including one to evaluate how Polaris can accommodate NASA's ice-prospecting instruments during.three-mile traverse near the moon's north pole.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The firm has dubbed the service MoonMail.It can even offer to give over entire missions for larger items that need more shipping space.Each capsule will be attached to Astrobotic's lunar lander, which will remain on the Moon for\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," By.Victoria Woollaston.The Yo app may have been criticised for being useless, but its brilliance was in its simplicity.

Suzanne Barr, chief of staff to ICE Director John Morton, said in her resignation letter that the allegations against her are 'unfounded.' But she said she was stepping down anyway to end distractions within the agency. ICE,.division of the Homeland Security Department, confirmed Barr had resigned. The Associated Press obtained.copy of Barr's letter. Barr is accused of sexually inappropriate behavior toward employees. The complaints are related to.sexual discrimination and retaliation lawsuit filed by.senior ICE agent in May.In her letter to Morton, Barr said she has been the subject of 'unfounded allegations designed to destroy my reputation' and is resigning 'with great regret.' 'Of greater concern however, is the threat these allegations represent to the reputation of this agency and the men and women who proudly serve their country by advancing ICE's mission,' Barr wrote. Former boss: Barr had been chief of staff for John Morton, pictured, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.'As such,.feel it is incumbent upon me to take every step necessary to prevent further harm to the agency and to prevent this from further distracting from our critical work.' Barr went on leave last month after the New York Post reported on the lawsuit filed by James T. Hayes Jr., ICE's special agent in charge in New York. Additional employees came forward with their allegations around the same time. In one complaint, Barr is accused of telling.male subordinate he was 'sexy' and asking.personal question about his anatomy during an office party. In.separate complaint, she is accused of offering to perform.sex act with.male subordinate during.business trip in Bogota, Colombia. She's also accused of calling.male subordinate from her hotel room and offering to perform.sex act. The names of two of Barr's accusers were censored in affidavits reviewed by AP. Homeland Security's office of professional responsibility and inspector general have been investigating the allegations. Prior to the lawsuit, there were no complaints about Barr, according to.homeland security official who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. Denial: The suit does not outline the nature of the relationship. Napolitano, pictured, has denied she is gay.In the lawsuit, Hayes described.'frat house' atmosphere at ICE designed to humiliate male employees under Barr's leadership. James.Hayes Jr, the head of the New York ICE office, filed.discrimination lawsuit against Napolitano earlier this year. The latest affidavits have been submitted to his attorney.Hayes, who was transferred to New York from ICE headquarters in Washington, is asking for more than $4million that, among other things, would cover compensation he believes he is owed for relocation expenses and financial losses associated with his transfer. Hayes' lawyer, Morris Fischer of Silver Spring, Maryland, has declined to comment. The Justice Department is seeking to dismiss Hayes' lawsuit on the basis that he did not state.claim for retaliation. Barr,.1995 graduate of the University of Arizona, was among Napolitano's first appointments after she became secretary in 2009. Barr started working for Napolitano in 2004, while Napolitano was governor of Arizona. Prior to that, Barr worked for Arizona Republican Sens. Jon Kyl and John McCain.

Horrible: This cow is bleeding heavily from an open wound and is not being treated by any employee at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin.Grim: Another cow is hoisted into the air while at Griese Brothers and frantically runs its legs to try and escape.Faced with.public relations disaster, the Wiese family said that they were 'shocked and saddened' at the footage and added they have 'zero tolerance for animal abuse.' They confirmed that the two employees seen in the video had been fired and.third removed from 'animal handling' responsibilities. 'Further action will be taken if the investigation warrants it,' said the statement. The local sheriff's department in Greenleaf said that they are investigating the alleged abuse and will be pressing charges if warranted. The video was shot undercover by.representative of the animal rights group Mercy for Animals in October and November and was then handed over to NBC News. Cruel: This cow is hanging in the air as.forklift truck operated by an employee reverses backwards.Poked pulled and prodded: This cow looks distressed as it is pulled by its head upwards by.tractor.'No socially responsible corporation should support dairy operations that beat, kick, mutilate and neglect animals,' said MFA's executive director, Nathan Runkle. 'Due to its complete lack of meaningful animal welfare standards, DiGiorno has allowed.culture of cruelty to flourish in its cheese supply chain.' The gruesome video reveals repeated examples of cruelty towards the livestock at Wiese Brothers farm as bleeding animals are beaten with sticks or kicked and dragged by their legs or necks. Speaking to NBC News, one livestock expert said the video showed unequivocal evidence of abuse. 'Dragging live cows, and completely suspending them with the cow lift is severe animal abuse,' said Temple Grandin, an associate professor of livestock behavior at Colorado State University and an animal welfare adviser to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Reality: This calf has been separated from its mother and could possibly be killed for veal at Wiese Brothers in Wisconsin.'The actions of these people went beyond rough handling and escalated to the level of cruelty. Kicking, beating, and hard whipping of downed cows is abusive.' Brown County Shefiff's Department said they were in the midst of an investigation after being handed the footage. 'It something we're looking into right now,' said Captain David Konrath. 'At the conclusion of the investigation we'll give the case to the district attorney and he will make.decision about whether charges would be filed.' Pizza and the farm: DiGiorno is the most popular brand of pizza in the United States and the milk its cheese suppliers use comes from Wiese Brothers.A Wiese family spokesperson said that they were working fully with Brown County Sheriff's Department and had invited an 'independent animal care auditor from.national evaluation firm' to come to their facility and begin.review of practices within 24 hours of being made aware of the footage in on November 26. 'We are shocked and saddened to see.few of our employees not following our farm's policies for proper animal care. We have zero tolerance for animal abuse. We are committed to providing optimal care and ask all our employees to demonstrate ongoing respect for every animal at all times,' the farm said. The farm, which has 4,500 cows that produce about 350,000 pounds of milk daily, was chosen at random to investigate.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Footage shows workers at Wiese Brothers Farm in Greenleaf, Wisconsin, beating the cows and dragging them with ropes from tractors.Comes after.documentary revealed sickening abuse against the cows kept there.The company has fired\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Sharp-eyed viewers criticised the first series of Downton Abbey when latter day sights including.TV aerial intruded into its Edwardian scenes.

Then.perfect lofted pass from Messi dropped into Neymar's path. The Brazilian should have scored without breaking stride but he sent his shot wide. Neymar was all flicks and tricks against Elche's five-man defence and on 35 minutes he was given another chance and this time he didn't miss, hammering home Suarez's slide-rule pass across the face of the six-yard box. Suarez could have opened his account on 38 minutes but his lob was finger-tipped away by Elche keeper PrzemysÅ‚aw Tyton. The former Liverpool striker was working hard though and he created an opening for himself just before half-time before drilling home the Barca second. Neymar was then tripped on the stroke of half-time and Messi scored the penalty, before blowing.kiss to supporters who were making it clear who they backed in the power struggle between coach and star player. Suarez was involved again 10 minutes into the second half, passing to Messi who threaded.pass through Elche's defence to Jordi Alba, who made it 4-0.

Most people could probably name.Scottish or Irish author, but how about.Polish one? Readers who are not Polish or of Polish descent face.few obstacles to opening the rich and different world of Polish literature. Firstly, Poland is not.world player, and we tend to become interested in.country's culture only when it is.global power or.real or possible threat to us. Secondly there is the spelling and pronouncing of names. We can handle the Russian transliteration of Gregory as Grigory. But the Polish for Gregory, alas, is Grzegorz. All those z's. (I played Scrabble with.friend in Warsaw:.player gets one point for.Z.) Obstacle three is that the jewel in the crown of Polish literature is its poetry, and unfortunately poetry is what usually gets lost in translation (though the translations have been improving). However it's worth facing and overcoming these obstacles, because the Polish way of looking at the world has plenty to teach us. If Polish literature began in the Renaissance it blossomed in mid-19th century Romanticism. The Shakespeare of Polish Romanticism was the poet Adam Mickiewicz. His \"Pan Tadeusz,\".novel in verse, restores.lost world through the magic of art. There is dalliance, swordplay, music,.hunt -- but even.humble vegetable patch delights. Fast forward to the 20th century and Polish poetry and drama took.turn towards the avant-garde. The poetry had been remarkable from the beginning, but Cyprian Norwid,.contemporary of Emily Dickinson (his verse is strikingly similar to her quiet, difficult lyricism), showed the way to modern understatement. Check out Zbigniew Herbert and Poland's Nobel laureate WisÅ‚awa Szymborska. Absurdism and dark humor are Polish specialties and appear in the playful stories and novels of Witold Gombrowicz. Lovers of science fiction should know StanisÅ‚aw Lem..KrakÃ³w native, Lem became internationally known for \"Solaris,\" (which gave rise to two films, one by Andrei Tarkovsky and.Hollywood version by Steven Soderbergh), satirical fantasy \"The Cyberiad,\" and essays on humanity and future technology. His work is marked by fun, pain, and.probing intelligence. READ MORE: Poland's tangible heritage.All these poets, playwrights, novelists, and essayists write about the human condition, but there has always been.political element to most Polish literature;.consequence of growing up in.country with.history of partition and repeated defeat. Poland was.major European power during the 17th and 18th centuries. However weak kings and lack of organization led to.political vacuum and the country ceased to exist without.fight in 1795 when Prussia, Austria, and Russia divided it up among themselves. Poland did not exist again as.state until after World War I. During that long period of nationlessness, poets and novelists strove to preserve Polish identity at home and abroad. Soldiers fought in other lands, hoping to make.future Poland possible; and young men periodically sacrificed themselves in uprisings that were crushed (1830, 1848, 1863). Poles became known for their idealism, their valor in the face of overwhelming odds, their splendid if suicidal recklessness, their patriotism, and -- understandably, given that over and over again this patriotism proved futile -- for their cynicism. The 20th century added another shadow to the Polish mind: the Holocaust; before World War II, Poland had the largest Jewish community in Europe. Poland fought with the Allies but \"in reward\" (a Polish smile of irony here) had to spend the next fifty years behind the Iron Curtain. Irony is not unique to Polish writers but they are masters of it. It's telling that an American writer much loved in Poland today is Philip K. Dick, who felt that the world was against him..offer an emblematic moment in Polish literature..much loved author to Poles is Henryk Sienkiewicz. In \"With Fire and Sword,\".historical novel set in the mid-17th century, the soldier Longinus PodbipiÄ™ta reminds us of Don Quixote. He has taken.vow of chastity and he may not pursue the object of his affections until he has cut off three enemy heads with.single blow of his enormous Crusader's sword. He manages that but then, without hesitation, offers himself up to martyrdom. The mix of humor, bitterness, and religious faith: very Polish.

But, while he's apologizing for poor word choice, his comments echo.truth spoken by many in New Orleans. \"It was.dumb thing to say, and.apologize,\" Duncan said Tuesday. In.Sunday broadcast of TV One's \"Washington Watch with Roland Martin,\" Duncan was asked about the progress New Orleans schools have made since Katrina hit in 2005. He replied: \"This is.tough thing to say, but let me be really honest..think the best thing that happened to the education system in New Orleans was Hurricane Katrina. That education system was.disaster, and it took Hurricane Katrina to wake up the community to say that 'We have to do better.'.Excerpts of the interview were released by the show Friday. Shortly afterward, numerous networks and newspapers picked them up, sparking the controversy that continued once the remarks were broadcast. Friday evening, Duncan called New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant, his office said. Duncan said Tuesday that he regrets what he said but insisted that the storm motivated the city to reinvest in its children like never before. \"I said it poorly. And my point was very simple. Hurricane Katrina was.devastating, devastating tragedy. The progress we've seen subsequent to that has been absolutely remarkable. The teachers, the principals there are working so incredibly hard,\" Duncan said. \"Almost all the students missed three months, four months, six months..talked to students who missed more than.year off school, and yet they came back. And in.short amount of time, four years, they came back, subsequent to the devastating tragedy. Amazing progress. And.just tip my hat to the hard work there..was simply trying to point out how impressed.am, the remarkable commitment and the sense of urgency.\" Several Louisiana officials defended Duncan's remarks. The state's superintendent of education, Paul Pastorek, said, \"I know it's.strong statement, but it's actually quite accurate. It was.pathetic system before the storm.\" Paul Vallas, superintendent of the Louisiana Recovery School District --.special program administered by the state with the aim of boosting underperforming schools -- noted that \"local people have said that time and time again.\" Duncan said in the TV One interview that New Orleans in the past \"was not serious about its education\" but called the school system's reform since Katrina \"unbelievable.\" Duncan has made several trips to New Orleans since becoming education secretary one year ago. His most recent was October 15. Regarding that city, Duncan said, \"What this is about was this huge sense of urgency. And folks understood you had to literally build from the ground up. ....just want to do whatever.can to continue to support the remarkable, remarkable progress.\" Education is.priority in the Obama administration, as evidenced by the president's proposed 2011 budget, released Monday, which would increase federal education spending by 7.5 percent, or $4 billion. Duncan is using federal dollars to promote reform in state and local school systems. He also is overhauling former President George W. Bush's Elementary and Secondary Education Act, better known as the No Child Left Behind Act. But Tuesday, he said, \"We talk about the growth of No Child Left Behind, and New Orleans is.prime example. Is it where it needs to be? No. Still, clearly, it's.long journey,.long ways to go. But the progress has been amazing.\"\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," NEW: \"It was.dumb thing to say, and.apologize,\" Duncan says in.Sunday broadcast of TV One's \"Washington Watch with Roland Martin\"Duncan calls New Orleans mayor Ray Nagin to explain what he meant\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," (CNN) -- When.new president strolls into the White House, there's.kick in his step and.twinkle in his eyes. This photo illustration projects what President-elect Barack Obama may look like in four years. But as the years go by, the high-stakes decisions, constant criticisms and the fluctuating public opinion chip away at the president. His shoulders slump.little and his energy may seem sapped. The president ages twice as fast while in office, according to.theory advanced by Dr. Michael Roizen,.chief wellness officer at the Cleveland Clinic. \"The typical person who lives one year ages one year,\" he said.  \"The typical president ages two years for every year they are in office.\" Using public information, Roizen looked through medical records of previous presidents back to Theodore Roosevelt. Assessing factors such as diet, blood pressure, physical activity and lifestyle habits, he calculated that the leader of the free world ages more quickly. Roizen, who is the author of \"RealAge: Are You as Young as You Can Be?\" has not assessed the \"real age\" of President-elect Barack Obama, who is 47, because of lack of medical data. \"Barack Obama is.fairly young guy and doesn't have great of.risk,\" Roizen said.  \"If he's president for eight years, he ends up having the risk of disability or dying, like someone who is 16 years older.\" Former president Bill Clinton entered the office with.robust head of salt-and-pepper hair and.healthy habit of running.  After bitter partisan battles, the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and impeachment by the House, Clinton left office with wrinkles and powder-white hair. \"Chronic stress can produce lots of wear and tear on the body,\" said James A. McCubbin,.Clemson University professor of psychology and senior associate dean of the College of Business and Behavioral Science. \"This is what we see in the changes in the appearance in the beginning and end of the presidency.\" Roizen points to the experience of Ronald Reagan. \"When Reagan came into office, he stood up absolutely straight. He was joking and incredibly quick-witted about current events. When he left office, he was hunched over. The age signs on face was there. His jokes were those of olden days rather than current events,\" he said.  See the toll of the presidency Â».On Wednesday, Obama, President George W. Bush, and all three living former presidents -- Jimmy Carter, George Herbert Walker Bush, and Clinton -- are meeting in the Oval Office and then having lunch together at the White House. After eight draining years in the Oval Office, an outgoing president like George W. Bush can reverse the tolls of stress by exercising and spending time with friends, Roizen says. \"Do as many healthy things as you can adopt,\" Roizen suggested.  \"The main thing he should do is finding what he wants to do with the rest of his life, which is tough for presidents to find something meaningful to do.\" During his second term, Bush dealt with.troubled war,.struggling economy, and sagging approval ratings.  But the avid runner, mountain biker and fisherman showed that his reflexes haven't slowed. \"I mean, did you see him dodge that shoe?\" said David Zinczenko, editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, referring to.December news conference in Iraq where an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at the president and Bush swiftly ducked the flying footwear. Twice. The incoming president is also no slacker. Although accused by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of having skinny legs, Obama regularly frequents the gym and plays basketball.

Presidents have enjoyed mountain biking (George W. Bush), golf (Clinton, Gerald Ford, Dwight D. Eisenhower), tennis (Ford, Carter, George H.W. Bush), jogging (Clinton, Carter and both Bushes), swimming (Ford), bowling (Richard Nixon), horseshoes (George H.W. Bush) and horseback riding (Reagan).

Ford talked about how when he was swimming laps, it gave him time to think about things.\" During the Democratic primaries, Obama worked out at the gym in the Cleveland Clinic the morning of his debate with then-rival Hilary Clinton. Living up to his nickname \"No Drama Obama,\" the candidate was remarkably calm, considering.high-stakes debate was to take place that night, Roizen recalled. \"Maybe he will age better, because he handles stress better,\" he said.  \"The fact that he smokes means he still has inner stress.\" Retaining.close group of friends and confidants is an important way to reduce the isolation of the presidency, Roizen said.

Scans of fossil teeth show the short and gangly South African Australopithecus sediba lived on.hard diet of trees, bushes and fruit two million years ago.similar to.chimpanzee. But virtually all other ancient human ancestors from Africa tucked into softer meals of grasses and sedges.even the 'Nutcracker Man', Paranthropus boisei, with his massive jaws and teeth. An analysis of the teeth of the short, gangly hominin australopithecus sediba shows it had.diet unlike virtually all of our other known ancestors.A. sediba had an upright posture and long arms, and embodied characteristics of both primitive and modern hominids.including.human-like ankle, short fingers and.long thumb for possible precision gripping and.relatively complex brain compared to earlier hominids. Researchers made the discovery by zapping fossilised teeth with.laser, which frees carbon from the enamel.allowing scientists to find the types of plants consumed and environments where the hominids lived. Although bark and woody tissues had not been documented as.dietary component of any other ancient African hominids before, these foods had been scoffed by many contemporary primates and contain both protein and soluble sugars. The diet of A. sediba also may have been similar to that of today's African savanna chimpanzees. The researchers also discovered microscopic, fossilised particles of plant tissue called phytoliths trapped in ancient tooth tartar.a hardened form of dental plague. University of Colorado Boulder doctoral student Paul Sandberg said: The fact that these phytoliths are preserved in the teeth of 2-million-year-old hominids is remarkable and speaks to the amazing preservation at the site. Boning up on the facts:.right hand skeleton of Australopithecus sediba superimposed against.modern human hand.Remarkable find: One of two sets of bones from Australopithecus Sediba are unveiled at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg this week.Ancient: Scientists say the bones are 1.977million years old.The phytolith data suggest the A. sediba individuals were avoiding the grasses growing in open grasslands that were abundant in the region at the time.It is an important finding because diet is one of the fundamental aspects of an animal, one that drives its behaviour and ecological niche. As environments change over time because of shifting climates, animals are generally forced to either move or to adapt to their new surroundings. What fascinates me is that these individuals are oddballs..had pretty much convinced myself that after.million years ago most of our hominid kin had diets that were different from living apes, but now.am not so sure. And while our sample is too small to be conclusive, the rate at which Malapa is spewing hominid fossils makes me reasonably certain we won't have to wait another two million years to augment our data set.' The study was published by Nature. It was helped by the University of Arkansas, Johns Hopkins University, the Bloemfontein National Museum and the University of Witwatersrand, both in South Africa, and Texas A&M University.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Scans of fossil teeth show the short and gangly South African Australopithecus sediba lived on.hard diet of trees, bushes and fruit two million years ago.It was discovered by zapping fossilised teeth with.laser\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," (CNN) -- Argentina football coach Diego Maradona has undergone plastic surgery on his face after being bitten by one of his dogs.

The bug, which the team has worked with Google, Facebook and other app makers to fix before revealing it, put millions of users at risk, the researchers said. The bug would allow hackers to steal user data from Facebook, Amazon and others using 'secret' keys the team uncovered. The Columbia Engineering Team found thousands of secret keys in android apps (shown by red arrows) that could be used to steal user data.The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. They were then able to decompile the apps to see their code. They then found developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. The research was revealed in.a paper presentedâ€”and awarded the prestigious Ken Sevcik Outstanding Student Paper Awardâ€”at the ACM SIGMETRICS conference. Jason Nieh, professor of computer science at Columbia Engineering, and PhD candidate Nicolas Viennot said they were stunned by the scale of their find. 'Google Play has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads, but no one reviews what gets put into Google Playâ€”anyone can get.$25 account and upload whatever they want. Very little is known about what's there at an aggregate level,' says Nieh.'Given the huge popularity of Google Play and the potential risks to millions of users, we thought it was important to take.close look at Google Play content.' Nieh and Viennot's paper is the first to make.large-scale measurement of the huge Google Play marketplace. The researchers created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google security to successfully download Google Play apps and recover their sources. PlayDrone scales by simply adding more servers and is fast enough to crawl Google Play on.daily basis, downloading more than 1.1 million Android apps and decompiling over 880,000 free applications. Google Play, the Android app store, has more than one million apps and over 50 billion app downloads.Nieh and Viennot discovered all kinds of new information about the content in Google Play, including.critical security problem: developers often store their secret keys in their apps software, similar to usernames/passwords info, and these can be then used by anyone to maliciously steal user data or resources from service providers such as Amazon and Facebook. These vulnerabilities can affect users even if they are not actively running the Android apps. Nieh claims that even \"Top Developers,\" designated by the Google Play team as the best developers on Google Play, included these vulnerabilities in their apps. 'We've been working closely with Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other service providers to identify and notify customers at risk, and make the Google Play store.safer place,' says Viennot. 'Google is now using our techniques to proactively scan apps for these problems to prevent this from happening again in the future.' In fact, Nieh adds, developers are already receiving notifications from Google to fix their apps and remove the secret keys.\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," The bug would allow hackers to steal user data from Facebook, Amazon and others using'secret' keys.Researchers found thousands of secret keys in android apps.They created an app called PlayDrone, which used various hacking techniques to circumvent Google\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," Chelsea have re-opened talks with Atletico Madrid over their move to sign Filipe Luis.

The two sources offered slightly different versions of who knew what, when. The diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous because he is not authorized to speak publicly, said Pakistan knew about the heightened intelligence activity, specifically in the city of Abbottabad, but \"never, never had any idea the operation was about bin Laden.\" The diplomat was approached privately by.Pakistani to inquire about heightened U.S. intelligence-gathering activities. He said it was assumed Pakistan was asking all Arab allies. Meanwhile, the senior Pakistani official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on intelligence matters, said Pakistan was indeed aware of \"heightened CIA activity in Pakistan\" in the weeks prior to the raid, but that the information officials had was not \"Abbottabad specific.\" \"If folks in Islamabad had been able to pinpoint Abbottabad, they would have done something about it,\" the official said. Relations between Pakistan and the United States have been increasingly strained since bin Laden was killed in.Navy SEAL raid in early May. U.S. officials believe Pakistan is not doing enough to go after al Qaeda and other extremists, while the Pakistanis are upset with what they consider to be unilateral steps taken by the United States within their borders. Washington did not give advance notice to Pakistani officials about the raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad. Senior U.S. officials also suspect that some in Pakistan helped bin Laden live there. CIA Director Leon Panetta reportedly has told legislators that Pakistan was either involved in helping the world's most wanted fugitive avoid detection or was incompetent for not knowing he was living on Pakistani soil. The Arab diplomat said he is sure officials in Pakistan \"had no idea where bin Laden was.\" He also said \"it was always clear Zawahiri was going to replace bin Laden,\" referring to Ayman al-Zawahiri, the longtime deputy to bin Laden who is thought to have taken over leadership of al Qaeda. \"It's not in their culture to go with someone else. They (al Qaeda) value loyalty,\" the diplomat said.

Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have.'patriotic duty' make the case for Brussels. And he warned that the Conservative Party's approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in.generation'. David Cameron has promised that if he remains prime minister after the election he will renegotiate Britain's EU membership before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. He has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out'.raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way. Today Labour warned business leaders they must start making the arguments against severing ties with Brussels. In.speech to ambassadors from all 28 EU member states, Mr Alexander said pro-EU business leaders should learn the lessons of the Scottish independence debate. Many companies delayed expressing.view until the last minute when polls suggest.Yes vote could win, but were then seen as playing.crucial role in shaping the final days of the campaign. Mr Alexander acknowledged that many business leaders are wary of getting involved in political debates. But he added: 'For business to speak up for Britain's place in Europe is not about party political advantage, it is about recognising both where our country's national interest and your business interests lies. 'It is about patriotic duty. And good business sense.' Leaving the EU would mean 'actively choosing an economy with weaker investment, less trade with the rest of the world, poorer productivity and worse living standards,' said Mr Alexander. He claimed Mr Cameron had become 'a much more marginal figure in Brussels', adding: 'Ukip is on the march, and David Cameron is running.' Last month the Prime Minister used his long-awaited immigration speech to insist that curbs on tax credits, child benefits, jobseekers allowance and council housing will be.key demand for his talks on renegotiating Britain's EU membership. Issuing.direct appeal for other European countries who have seen thousands of their citizens move to the UK to support limiting movement across the continent, he insisted his demands were not 'outlandish' and Britain deserves 'to be heard'. And he threatened to block any new countries joining the EU unless controls are imposed to stop their citizens flocking to more successful economies like Britain. But Mr Alexander warned that.Conservative victory in the 2015 election would mean that within the course of the next Parliament, Britain could be out of Europe and thrust into.'full-blown constitutional crisis'. 'The truth is that.Conservative government in 2015 would mean breaking not simply with the record of the last government, it would mean breaking with decades of history that have defined the country we are today, how our country is run, and the place we have in the world,' he said. 'That risk is real. And so too is the responsibility on business to now find its voice and to make the case with authority and passion, that the right road for Britain is not exit from Europe but reform within Europe.' David Cameron, pictured with pupils James Samur (centre) and George Bateman during.physics class at the Harris City Academy, has promised to renegotiate Britain's membership of the EU.The Prime Minister has made clear that without agreement on curbing benefits, he will 'rule nothing out'.raising the prospect of backing Britain's exit from the EU if he does not get his way.In.message to the 'quiet majority' of UK business leaders who he said were concerned about EU exit, he added: 'Now is the time to speak out. Now is the time to speak up. Because you know what is most at stake. You know what we have to lose. Your voice must be heard, because if you wait, it could be too late.' Mr Alexander said that Labour would push for reform of the EU, rather than exit, arguing for the creation of.Council of the Single Market to defend the interests of non-eurozone members and for changes to competition rules to allow national governments to support firms at times of crisis. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of manufacturers' organisation EEF, said: 'Manufacturers remain overwhelmingly of the view that our economic well-being and long term strategic interest of this country is dependent on being.full and leading player in the EU. Equally we do recognise that reform of the EU is also.key requirement. 'We do not want uncertainty on this subject. Jobs, investment and trade are all dependent on.thriving and effective EU, with Britain at its heart. That's what we all need to be striving to achieve.' Alisdair McIntosh, director of pro-reform pressure group Business for New Europe, said: 'The debate about our EU membership is about the national interest. Investment, growth and jobs are at stake. 'EU membership is particularly important to vital industries including aerospace, the automotive sector, engineering and pharmaceuticals. It also plays.crucial role in facilitating research and development. These areas are critical for jobs and competitiveness. Politicians and business leaders alike need to reflect this.'\n","\n","Generated Summary:\n"," Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said business leaders have.'patriotic duty' to make the case for EU.He warned that Tories approach to Europe poses 'the biggest risk to British national prosperity in.generation'Mr Alexander said pro-EU\n","\n","\n","Original Article:\n"," A former British boxing champion accused of helping two men flee to Syria to fight with Islamic State (ISIS) will stand trial in June.

Flight 79 took off from Heathrow Airport at.p.m. (10 a.m. ET), destined for Dallas, Texas, according to American Airlines' website. The Boeing 777-200 airliner made it over the United States, but not to its final destination. It was diverted to Tulsa due to an issue with the plane's left engine, American Airlines spokeswoman Laura Masvidal told CNN. She did not specify what the issue was. Its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at Tulsa's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. CT (7:30 p.m. ET). One problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that Tulsa's airport doesn't have U.S. Customs and Border Protection workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers. That means the aircraft's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport's tarmac, according to Masvidal. The aircraft that will take them to Dallas was set to leave that Texas city around 9:15 p.m. for Tulsa. According to American's website, it should have Flight 79's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs Oklahoma at 10 p.m. If all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.few minutes after 11 p.m. local time. For those keeping score at home, that amounts to 14 hours after Flight 79's passengers first took off from London.

'She's focused on her career,' the 39-year-old New Yorker said. 'The most important thing for me is to get married and have kids.' Scroll down for video... Before the break: Nick Loeb, pictured with Sofia Vergara in May just before their split, told InTouch they broke up because she didn't want to have children with him.The Loeb's Crunch founder added, 'I completely understand. She's at the height of her career, and, as she says all the time, she's taking advantage of her 15 minutes of fame because who knows how long that will last.' At age 42, Vergara is at the height of her career with.hit TV series (Modern Family) and  starring roles in movies (such as Fading Gigolo). The cover girl also has numerous endorsement deals and her own perfume, which launched in September.

The two were caught getting cozy in New York City earlier this month, according to UsWeekly. Stone and Vergara worked together on Fading Gigolo, which was released in 2013. Still, Vergara and Loeb seem to be on good terms. AtNew York's Angel Ball on Monday evening they said hello to each other. Sofia was being interviewed by Extra's AJ Calloway. Whether Loeb planned the meeting or just happened to pass by his former fiancee, he didn't get much of.reaction on the carpet. Their meeting was brief.
